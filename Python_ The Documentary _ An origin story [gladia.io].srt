1
00:00:01.052 --> 00:00:03.895
Do you think Python was going to get popular from the beginning?

2
00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:21.068
Python has contributed to making critical thinking a little more approachable by more people.

3
00:00:21.396 --> 00:00:25.379
You can spend one to two hours learning programming fundamentals,

4
00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:29.457
and then you can write like 10 to 20 lines of code that do something interesting.

5
00:00:29.647 --> 00:00:30.288
The language,

6
00:00:30.388 --> 00:00:31.047
the community,

7
00:00:31.208 --> 00:00:32.368
the ecosystem,

8
00:00:32.468 --> 00:00:33.088
the market,

9
00:00:33.448 --> 00:00:37.091
the whole thing has had such an impact on humanity.

10
00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:37.692
Today,

11
00:00:37.747 --> 00:00:40.512
I think it's safe to say that almost anywhere there's a computer,

12
00:00:40.591 --> 00:00:41.872
there's probably some Python.

13
00:00:42.348 --> 00:00:44.247
It's literally on Mars.

14
00:00:45.387 --> 00:00:46.505
The impact of AI,

15
00:00:46.646 --> 00:00:48.990
I think we're still seeing what that's going to be.

16
00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.240
Python is incredibly important for that.

17
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.786
To fully understand how Python got so big,

18
00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:56.396
we have to go back in time.

19
00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:01.462
Maybe not that far back.

20
00:01:02.862 --> 00:01:04.805
Everything started back in Amsterdam in the

21
00:01:05.185 --> 00:01:07.067
80s, during my time at CWI,

22
00:01:07.368 --> 00:01:08.787
a Dutch research facility.

23
00:01:11.552 --> 00:01:17.521
The CWI had been behind a lot of major programming language developments,

24
00:01:17.771 --> 00:01:19.599
Algos 60 and Algos 68,

25
00:01:19.614 --> 00:01:20.302
for instance.

26
00:01:21.067 --> 00:01:21.364
And

27
00:01:21.724 --> 00:01:28.942
Lombeer-Meertens had tried teaching programming to artists and discovered things about programming.

28
00:01:29.408 --> 00:01:32.251
That are easy if you're a scientist or a geek.

29
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.492
But for somebody like an artist,

30
00:01:34.772 --> 00:01:39.456
those things weren't obvious because you had to know something about the computer.

31
00:01:39.777 --> 00:01:44.284
The cost of the frustration was the low level of languages that were available.

32
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.120
The computers were immensely expensive.

33
00:01:47.385 --> 00:01:48.605
And compared with that,

34
00:01:49.027 --> 00:01:50.323
a programmer was really,

35
00:01:50.402 --> 00:01:50.963
really cheap.

36
00:01:51.823 --> 00:01:57.260
And so programming languages were designed with that economic relationship in mind.

37
00:01:57.683 --> 00:01:58.683
It didn't matter.

38
00:01:59.028 --> 00:02:00.810
If it took a long time to program,

39
00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:04.313
as long as it didn't demand too much of the computer,

40
00:02:04.373 --> 00:02:05.915
because that's where the cost was.

41
00:02:07.016 --> 00:02:08.337
We looked at each other and said,

42
00:02:08.438 --> 00:02:09.478
can't we do a better job?

43
00:02:09.641 --> 00:02:12.181
Can't we design a language that is easy to learn,

44
00:02:12.282 --> 00:02:13.118
easy to teach,

45
00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:15.502
but also easy to use?

46
00:02:15.766 --> 00:02:22.252
So that beginners could understand how to program without having to go into all those messy hardware details.

47
00:02:22.391 --> 00:02:23.313
And that's how the

48
00:02:23.752 --> 00:02:25.096
ABC project was born.

49
00:02:28.063 --> 00:02:31.307
One of the members of that team was Guido van Rossum.

50
00:02:39.795 --> 00:02:42.359
I was hired to work on ABC,

51
00:02:42.975 --> 00:02:45.038
for which there was a small prototype,

52
00:02:45.835 --> 00:02:51.007
but every part of the prototype had to be expanded to fully working according to the spec.

53
00:02:54.207 --> 00:02:56.069
In 1985,

54
00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.890
we made the release of ABC.

55
00:02:59.212 --> 00:03:00.573
And then we hit the problem,

56
00:03:01.155 --> 00:03:04.474
how to make the world know that there was ABC.

57
00:03:05.358 --> 00:03:10.811
We did not have a good way of reaching our intended audience.

58
00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:12.701
The internet did not exist.

59
00:03:13.045 --> 00:03:17.264
Most people had never heard of a computer or even seen one.

60
00:03:17.748 --> 00:03:18.998
If anybody wanted a copy,

61
00:03:19.451 --> 00:03:20.592
they had to send us a letter,

62
00:03:21.233 --> 00:03:22.780
and we'd send them a floppy disk.

63
00:03:24.376 --> 00:03:27.800
So I'm afraid ABC reached very few people.

64
00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:29.100
And at some point,

65
00:03:29.102 --> 00:03:29.819
the directors,

66
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.984
for a reason that I still don't understand,

67
00:03:32.284 --> 00:03:33.543
killed that project.

68
00:03:34.104 --> 00:03:34.847
I had spent,

69
00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.769
well,

70
00:03:35.871 --> 00:03:44.300
three and a half years of hard work on this language and the implementation to make it as good as we could.

71
00:03:44.597 --> 00:03:45.737
So it was disappointing.

72
00:03:45.753 --> 00:03:52.081
Guido was transferred to another project.

73
00:03:52.644 --> 00:03:54.925
On a distributed operating system,

74
00:03:55.407 --> 00:03:56.588
the AmoeBa system.

75
00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:02.233
One of my jobs at that project as the programmer,

76
00:04:02.295 --> 00:04:03.193
not the researcher,

77
00:04:03.451 --> 00:04:09.552
was to write or help write a large number of user applications.

78
00:04:10.224 --> 00:04:14.177
And I didn't actually think that for many of those utilities,

79
00:04:15.021 --> 00:04:16.725
C was a very good language.

80
00:04:18.552 --> 00:04:19.225
And I thought,

81
00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:19.694
well,

82
00:04:19.896 --> 00:04:20.630
oh man,

83
00:04:20.694 --> 00:04:21.413
if we just could...

84
00:04:21.776 --> 00:04:24.317
Program ABC instead of C.

85
00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.983
Each of those utilities would be like half a page of code,

86
00:04:28.103 --> 00:04:31.584
and I could write the entire suite of utilities in a couple of weeks,

87
00:04:32.247 --> 00:04:35.326
instead of the years that it looked like it was going to take us.

88
00:04:36.192 --> 00:04:36.951
Except that

89
00:04:37.591 --> 00:04:40.850
ABC was so high and abstract,

90
00:04:40.959 --> 00:04:51.350
it wasn't a good language to talk to. Servers and file systems and processes, and it's sort of the whole operating system thing.

91
00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.043
Was abstracted away from ABC.

92
00:04:54.584 --> 00:04:55.283
So I thought,

93
00:04:55.343 --> 00:04:55.504
well,

94
00:04:55.523 --> 00:05:00.408
there really ought to be a language that sort of bridges the gap between C and shell.

95
00:05:01.088 --> 00:05:02.329
And we looked at Perl,

96
00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:07.298
and we didn't think it was any good as a programming language.

97
00:05:08.721 --> 00:05:11.110
It was about as bad as basic,

98
00:05:11.173 --> 00:05:12.346
although in different ways.

99
00:05:12.735 --> 00:05:17.829
So Python was also in a part built as an alternative to Perl.

100
00:05:18.704 --> 00:05:19.721
That's where I decided,

101
00:05:19.908 --> 00:05:20.033
oh,

102
00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.314
well.

103
00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:23.903
I'm going to see if I can make my own programming language.

104
00:05:28.809 --> 00:05:30.048
One Christmas holiday,

105
00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.548
I believe,

106
00:05:30.726 --> 00:05:37.218
He decided to spend his time designing and building a new programming language for the operating system,

107
00:05:37.735 --> 00:05:41.016
based on the principles that he'd learned while on the ABC project.

108
00:05:42.016 --> 00:05:44.750
It was logical that I would start with ABC as

109
00:05:45.201 --> 00:05:45.980
as an example.

110
00:05:46.221 --> 00:05:55.262
The most prominent feature that Python borrowed from ABC is actually the use of indentation for statement grouping.

111
00:05:55.583 --> 00:06:01.848
But it was also logical that I sort of dropped the things from ABC that I didn't particularly like.

112
00:06:02.052 --> 00:06:03.223
That's how we ended up with

113
00:06:03.692 --> 00:06:04.129
Python.

114
00:06:10.286 --> 00:06:11.348
Okay.

115
00:06:13.812 --> 00:06:17.115
I finally was confident enough of the interpreter,

116
00:06:17.216 --> 00:06:18.478
was complete enough that

117
00:06:18.939 --> 00:06:20.617
I showed it to Lambert.

118
00:06:20.619 --> 00:06:24.586
He showed me a language he had developed stealthily,

119
00:06:24.946 --> 00:06:26.048
which he calls Python,

120
00:06:26.384 --> 00:06:27.649
named after Monty Python.

121
00:06:28.704 --> 00:06:29.048
I said,

122
00:06:29.125 --> 00:06:29.923
look what I made.

123
00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:34.266
It was clear to me that it had some resemblance to ABC.

124
00:06:34.798 --> 00:06:36.750
The command line prompt is even the same.

125
00:06:37.516 --> 00:06:37.641
So

126
00:06:38.064 --> 00:06:41.000
Lambert watched me type a few things and...

127
00:06:41.002 --> 00:06:41.579
And he was.

128
00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:46.324
Excited about it, and he apparently thought I would be excited as well.

129
00:06:46.547 --> 00:06:48.309
At some point he had seen enough and he said,

130
00:06:48.327 --> 00:06:49.367
Can I try something?

131
00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:54.153
And he types one very short line of code and it crashes the interpreter.

132
00:06:57.112 --> 00:06:58.894
And he knew that it would.

133
00:06:59.723 --> 00:07:00.644
The point escaped me.

134
00:07:00.675 --> 00:07:07.362
I didn't know why he thought this was better than ABC and why he had done this whole project.

135
00:07:07.581 --> 00:07:10.004
I went back and the next day I had a fix for it.

136
00:07:11.632 --> 00:07:13.654
It was a pretty crushing experience,

137
00:07:13.656 --> 00:07:14.396
to be honest.

138
00:07:28.654 --> 00:07:33.170
It must have been at least half a year later that I first got acquainted with Python.

139
00:07:33.858 --> 00:07:35.451
So this is the office where

140
00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:39.701
Guido and I were holed up when he created Python.

141
00:07:40.257 --> 00:07:42.059
There were two important users.

142
00:07:42.139 --> 00:07:44.863
Sjoerd was one of them, and the other was Jack Janssen.

143
00:07:47.485 --> 00:07:51.488
Guido was sitting over there and I was sitting over there.

144
00:07:52.309 --> 00:07:54.269
If you want to prototype a program,

145
00:07:54.831 --> 00:07:58.903
you sort of write the outlines of the program,

146
00:07:59.168 --> 00:08:00.403
but it doesn't actually work.

147
00:08:00.793 --> 00:08:01.870
When you do this in Python,

148
00:08:02.184 --> 00:08:02.995
it actually works.

149
00:08:03.355 --> 00:08:04.105
It's readable,

150
00:08:04.793 --> 00:08:06.245
it's very easy to program,

151
00:08:06.887 --> 00:08:09.089
and the indentation is totally natural.

152
00:08:09.617 --> 00:08:10.898
As far as I'm concerned, anyway.

153
00:08:11.399 --> 00:08:14.882
Sjoerd and Jack were the most active in using Python.

154
00:08:15.221 --> 00:08:15.904
You find bugs,

155
00:08:16.002 --> 00:08:18.201
you find the things that you want to extend.

156
00:08:18.389 --> 00:08:19.624
And then telling me about it,

157
00:08:19.725 --> 00:08:21.468
because all they had to do was say,

158
00:08:21.569 --> 00:08:22.093
Hey, Guido.

159
00:08:23.249 --> 00:08:27.858
It was the first real interactive systems programming language,

160
00:08:27.874 --> 00:08:31.560
so you could just sit and write and run it immediately, without any compilation.

161
00:08:31.764 --> 00:08:35.249
So it was much more fun to use than the old programming languages,

162
00:08:35.576 --> 00:08:36.107
but slower.

163
00:08:39.157 --> 00:08:41.980
I think it was mostly Jack's idea in the end,

164
00:08:42.059 --> 00:08:43.240
while we all worked on it,

165
00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:45.224
to make an open source release.

166
00:08:45.763 --> 00:08:47.345
CWI allowed

167
00:08:47.688 --> 00:08:52.447
Guido to distribute Python to the world as long as this copyright notice was there.

168
00:08:53.134 --> 00:08:57.813
They would have held back if they had known it would be such an incredible success.

169
00:08:58.298 --> 00:08:59.783
Which is good that they didn't know.

170
00:08:59.923 --> 00:09:00.438
Nobody knew.

171
00:09:00.595 --> 00:09:01.595
I didn't either.

172
00:09:01.953 --> 00:09:03.658
Because if they had held back,

173
00:09:03.703 --> 00:09:06.078
it would never have become an incredible success.

174
00:09:08.876 --> 00:09:11.698
Then we had to actually physically do the release,

175
00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:13.980
which turned out to be an incredible pain,

176
00:09:14.043 --> 00:09:17.488
because Usenet was the only thing we had to release it.

177
00:09:22.831 --> 00:09:25.385
UseNet was a network of,

178
00:09:26.027 --> 00:09:26.480
you could say,

179
00:09:26.573 --> 00:09:27.418
bulletin boards.

180
00:09:28.293 --> 00:09:29.635
People would write messages,

181
00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.980
they would get distributed over the world,

182
00:09:32.152 --> 00:09:36.182
and then there were the groups for all the different computer languages.

183
00:09:38.557 --> 00:09:42.462
Usenit had a very strict limit on the size of a single post.

184
00:09:43.041 --> 00:09:43.399
First,

185
00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:46.346
put your entire source tree in a tarball.

186
00:09:47.688 --> 00:09:48.649
Then compress it.

187
00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:53.009
Then you have to do another step where you turn the binary data into

188
00:09:53.494 --> 00:09:54.626
ASCII encoding.

189
00:09:55.673 --> 00:09:59.235
So you have this huge file with gobbledygook,

190
00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:02.126
but it's at least printable gobbledygook.

191
00:10:02.846 --> 00:10:05.705
Then you apply another tool that snips it into pieces.

192
00:10:07.476 --> 00:10:11.981
Then there is a script where if you have downloaded all 21 parts,

193
00:10:12.384 --> 00:10:15.164
you can undo all those operations in reverse.

194
00:10:16.086 --> 00:10:17.625
That was what people put up with.

195
00:10:17.743 --> 00:10:28.259
So we did all the work on our side and plenty of people did all the work on their side to unpack this. Because I had apparently written a very good teaser of what this was.

196
00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:36.721
Very quickly,

197
00:10:37.041 --> 00:10:46.147
I started getting feedback via email or Usenax from people who had done something exciting with it, or who had found a bug.

198
00:10:46.623 --> 00:10:47.764
And that just kept coming.

199
00:10:51.107 --> 00:10:52.505
We worked at Johnson Space Center.

200
00:10:52.850 --> 00:11:02.005
So our interest was putting together flight simulations and tools for the design engineers that would be used for a shuttle program at the time.

201
00:11:04.793 --> 00:11:13.041
I remember needing a scripting language to control a C++ library project we were working on at the time.

202
00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:16.423
Not too long into that search,

203
00:11:16.884 --> 00:11:20.048
I found Guidos Python Distribution at CWI.

204
00:11:20.572 --> 00:11:22.274
I was able to FTP that down,

205
00:11:25.572 --> 00:11:26.057
unpack it,

206
00:11:27.087 --> 00:11:27.587
compile it,

207
00:11:28.916 --> 00:11:31.384
and run it in a matter of 10 minutes or so.

208
00:11:32.836 --> 00:11:36.823
That was my first impressive experience with Python.

209
00:11:37.385 --> 00:11:38.148
Twenty years ago,

210
00:11:38.586 --> 00:11:45.879
a computer that cost a million dollars and filled an entire room had less capability than an 11-pound desktop computer today.

211
00:11:46.859 --> 00:11:49.461
With costs going down and capabilities going up,

212
00:11:49.981 --> 00:11:52.845
the computer has entered our lives quickly and unobtrusively.

213
00:11:53.243 --> 00:11:59.774
There were lots of things changing in a major way that made computing particularly exciting to be in at that time.

214
00:12:00.009 --> 00:12:04.461
Computers suddenly were coming out of the machine room and landing up on your desk,

215
00:12:04.711 --> 00:12:04.961
and then,

216
00:12:04.977 --> 00:12:05.259
of course,

217
00:12:05.259 --> 00:12:05.993
the web happened,

218
00:12:06.134 --> 00:12:07.211
then it all exploded.

219
00:12:08.086 --> 00:12:10.539
After the internet came to Europe,

220
00:12:10.618 --> 00:12:13.461
it was much easier for software to be distributed.

221
00:12:13.868 --> 00:12:15.822
Python very slowly...

222
00:12:16.407 --> 00:12:16.807
Took off.

223
00:12:17.548 --> 00:12:21.451
Then there was a growing Python community, which was very supportive,

224
00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:24.154
like a big family, you could almost say.

225
00:12:30.357 --> 00:12:32.100
Part of the benefit of this is that

226
00:12:33.279 --> 00:12:33.639
I don't,

227
00:12:34.264 --> 00:12:36.514
I'm like, there's no strain on my body at all.

228
00:12:37.654 --> 00:12:45.749
I was working on developing a kind of distributed equipment database, and a colleague at the lab,

229
00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:52.616
Michael McClay, knew that. I was looking for what was called a scripting language that was also sophisticated,

230
00:12:52.777 --> 00:12:57.866
that would enable you to build substantial things and not get bogged down in the ragged edges.

231
00:12:58.163 --> 00:13:03.070
Scripting languages were designed to glue things together,

232
00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:04.881
to connect things that already worked,

233
00:13:04.913 --> 00:13:06.053
that already existed.

234
00:13:06.445 --> 00:13:07.710
Immediately on trying it,

235
00:13:07.756 --> 00:13:09.960
I was just amazed and thought,

236
00:13:10.053 --> 00:13:11.663
this can't be as good as it is.

237
00:13:12.023 --> 00:13:12.475
And it was.

238
00:13:14.115 --> 00:13:17.558
Mike was interested in bringing Guido over,

239
00:13:18.097 --> 00:13:20.140
and Guido was interested in coming over.

240
00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:21.621
99%

241
00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:25.706
of the people that I got in touch with were in the United States.

242
00:13:26.386 --> 00:13:26.504
So

243
00:13:27.105 --> 00:13:28.028
Guido ended up coming.

244
00:13:28.785 --> 00:13:30.192
And then Mike and

245
00:13:30.535 --> 00:13:39.614
Guido and I wanted to arrange a workshop so people who were interested in Python could gather and talk about what they were working on and what they felt was needed.

246
00:13:41.176 --> 00:13:43.004
This is the t-shirt for the first.

247
00:13:43.174 --> 00:13:43.855
conference.

248
00:13:43.856 --> 00:13:44.436
And so this,

249
00:13:46.017 --> 00:13:46.278
yeah,

250
00:13:46.719 --> 00:13:48.541
that was just sort of flowy writing.

251
00:13:48.599 --> 00:13:49.763
And on the back,

252
00:13:51.287 --> 00:13:54.287
it gave the date of the conference.

253
00:13:54.748 --> 00:13:55.005
Spum,

254
00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:55.403
spum,

255
00:13:55.528 --> 00:13:55.809
spum,

256
00:13:55.927 --> 00:13:56.248
spum.

257
00:13:56.990 --> 00:13:58.309
It's such a fantastic song.

258
00:13:59.395 --> 00:14:01.130
That workshop really is,

259
00:14:01.177 --> 00:14:01.427
for me,

260
00:14:01.599 --> 00:14:03.255
the beginning of the Python community,

261
00:14:03.333 --> 00:14:04.817
November 1994,

262
00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:05.958
Gaithersburg,

263
00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:06.583
Maryland,

264
00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:09.755
in this windowless government office building at NIST.

265
00:14:10.287 --> 00:14:11.349
That was a great experience.

266
00:14:11.442 --> 00:14:12.349
That was about two days.

267
00:14:13.071 --> 00:14:13.892
We had 20 people.

268
00:14:14.652 --> 00:14:17.073
I still have the t-shirt from that workshop.

269
00:14:17.394 --> 00:14:19.557
There was just kind of this feel of,

270
00:14:19.635 --> 00:14:19.777
hey,

271
00:14:19.859 --> 00:14:20.918
there's something happening.

272
00:14:20.961 --> 00:14:25.484
This will be fun to hang out with the people that I chat with online.

273
00:14:25.702 --> 00:14:28.547
Actually see Guido in person and actually make decisions.

274
00:14:28.548 --> 00:14:33.155
And we knew that if you impressed him with the feature and it was an easy thing to install,

275
00:14:33.187 --> 00:14:37.092
he would add it to the language right there. So that we can at least try it out in beta form.

276
00:14:37.312 --> 00:14:40.234
It was like a whole room of people who knew what you were talking about.

277
00:14:40.506 --> 00:14:42.849
Because they had all studied Python deeply,

278
00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:44.129
or almost all.

279
00:14:45.532 --> 00:14:47.231
One of the people was Barry Warsaw.

280
00:14:47.232 --> 00:14:57.349
Around 1994,

281
00:14:57.427 --> 00:14:58.270
I joined a company,

282
00:14:58.427 --> 00:14:59.145
CNRI,

283
00:14:59.379 --> 00:15:01.427
Corporation for National Research Initiatives.

284
00:15:02.004 --> 00:15:05.254
And we were building these software agents,

285
00:15:05.552 --> 00:15:07.474
little programs that can move around.

286
00:15:07.658 --> 00:15:14.318
To different computers on a network. And they pickle themselves up and move around to another place and reconstitute themselves and do some more work.

287
00:15:14.799 --> 00:15:16.260
A friend of mine from

288
00:15:16.721 --> 00:15:19.143
NIST sent me an email and said,

289
00:15:19.158 --> 00:15:19.283
hey,

290
00:15:19.339 --> 00:15:23.260
we've got this guy coming over from the Netherlands and he's going to talk about his language.

291
00:15:23.283 --> 00:15:24.096
Do you want to come?

292
00:15:24.268 --> 00:15:32.378
And so we went to the workshop and just absolutely fell in love with, of course, Python and of course, Guido.

293
00:15:32.783 --> 00:15:33.628
Even then,

294
00:15:34.018 --> 00:15:36.658
it had the feeling that there was a there there.

295
00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:39.734
That there was something that was going to happen,

296
00:15:39.773 --> 00:15:40.995
that there was potential.

297
00:15:41.214 --> 00:15:43.437
I remember coming back to CNRI and saying,

298
00:15:43.519 --> 00:15:44.135
Oh, this is great,

299
00:15:44.159 --> 00:15:46.698
we're going to use Python, for sure, in our project.

300
00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:50.323
And one of our colleagues at CNRI said,

301
00:15:50.924 --> 00:15:51.629
Well, what do you think,

302
00:15:51.721 --> 00:15:53.581
why don't we just hire Guido?

303
00:16:04.644 --> 00:16:06.721
CNRI was set up to sort of promote

304
00:16:07.154 --> 00:16:08.514
information infrastructure,

305
00:16:08.634 --> 00:16:09.635
foster research,

306
00:16:10.535 --> 00:16:12.076
help build pilot projects,

307
00:16:12.596 --> 00:16:13.534
take the results,

308
00:16:14.057 --> 00:16:17.780
and put them out into the public so that others could then leverage it.

309
00:16:18.014 --> 00:16:21.562
Part of CNRI's mission was to cultivate internet-based things.

310
00:16:21.835 --> 00:16:23.405
That's why our name,

311
00:16:23.812 --> 00:16:26.280
Corporation for National Research Initiatives,

312
00:16:26.764 --> 00:16:28.451
had four initiatives in there.

313
00:16:32.826 --> 00:16:36.437
We had a need for a language that

314
00:16:36.863 --> 00:16:43.239
would be easier for people to deal with than any other traditional languages that were around at the time.

315
00:16:43.621 --> 00:16:45.039
I ran across a photograph.

316
00:16:45.101 --> 00:16:46.407
There was a party at sea.

317
00:16:46.962 --> 00:16:47.403
.Year. ago.

318
00:16:47.924 --> 00:16:48.664
It was probably,

319
00:16:48.725 --> 00:16:49.046
I think,

320
00:16:49.446 --> 00:16:52.690
1996.

321
00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:55.049
And it's a Guido Ramos.

322
00:16:56.033 --> 00:16:56.150
Yeah,

323
00:16:56.152 --> 00:16:56.956
I used to say Guido.

324
00:16:57.214 --> 00:16:58.236
Many people say Guido,

325
00:16:58.315 --> 00:16:59.072
but I said Guido.

326
00:16:59.456 --> 00:17:02.480
And I'm sure I don't pronounce it right.

327
00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:02.596
Oh,

328
00:17:02.597 --> 00:17:04.144
he was a very stylish person.

329
00:17:04.299 --> 00:17:05.799
He was a very strong fellow.

330
00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:07.096
I got introduced to him,

331
00:17:07.346 --> 00:17:08.987
and it just seemed like it was a good fit.

332
00:17:09.065 --> 00:17:10.580
And so I made the job offer.

333
00:17:10.769 --> 00:17:11.049
For me,

334
00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:12.424
it was fantastic.

335
00:17:13.221 --> 00:17:14.690
There's no doubt about that.

336
00:17:14.971 --> 00:17:15.315
One of the

337
00:17:15.398 --> 00:17:16.601
things he insists on,

338
00:17:16.901 --> 00:17:18.320
if you want to get him to work for you,

339
00:17:18.421 --> 00:17:20.385
is that he has some fraction of his time,

340
00:17:21.463 --> 00:17:23.346
preferably as much as half time,

341
00:17:23.347 --> 00:17:23.963
if not more,

342
00:17:24.424 --> 00:17:25.791
to work on the language itself.

343
00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:28.494
The fact that they could work full-time on Python,

344
00:17:29.471 --> 00:17:35.651
because it turned out that the Nobots project was almost more an excuse to hire me than

345
00:17:35.994 --> 00:17:37.198
I did. Much for that.

346
00:17:38.119 --> 00:17:42.151
I kind of feel like our work on Python was a little subversive.

347
00:17:42.385 --> 00:17:42.666
You know,

348
00:17:42.682 --> 00:17:42.807
we...

349
00:17:43.222 --> 00:17:46.625
Tended to spend a lot more time on Python than maybe we should have.

350
00:17:46.987 --> 00:17:50.229
I went to CNRI and since I had been a systems person,

351
00:17:50.749 --> 00:17:53.593
I was responsible for setting up python.org.

352
00:17:54.154 --> 00:18:04.226
We should have also grabbed Python.com, even though we didn't think of Python as a commercial enterprise. Because someone else got it and used it to host this stupid porn site.

353
00:18:04.601 --> 00:18:05.226
For years,

354
00:18:05.257 --> 00:18:06.585
we had to warn people,

355
00:18:06.804 --> 00:18:08.007
go to python.org,

356
00:18:08.101 --> 00:18:08.788
not .com.

357
00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:15.432
It really was the perfect home,

358
00:18:15.653 --> 00:18:15.992
I think,

359
00:18:16.073 --> 00:18:21.460
for doing all of that early Python development and develop a lot of the infrastructure around Python.

360
00:18:21.619 --> 00:18:29.874
We had a meeting discussing making some kind of user group or software organization where the Python software activity was proposed.

361
00:18:30.124 --> 00:18:31.343
We need a little bit of governance,

362
00:18:31.654 --> 00:18:33.249
a little bit of organization,

363
00:18:33.529 --> 00:18:37.108
but we don't want too much because I don't think any of us really like bureaucracy.

364
00:18:37.779 --> 00:18:41.671
And then the question came up about what we should call Guido as part of that.

365
00:18:41.874 --> 00:18:42.654
I think it was.

366
00:18:43.346 --> 00:18:43.467
Me,

367
00:18:43.686 --> 00:18:44.688
who suggested that

368
00:18:45.670 --> 00:18:47.633
Guido be called a benevolent dictator.

369
00:18:48.292 --> 00:18:51.292
And then Barry suggested benevolent dictator for life.

370
00:18:52.636 --> 00:18:54.855
And that became an internet meme,

371
00:18:54.917 --> 00:18:57.160
or actually a software meme.

372
00:18:57.441 --> 00:18:58.785
Benevolent dictator for life.

373
00:19:00.207 --> 00:19:01.785
You can find it on Wikipedia.

374
00:19:04.191 --> 00:19:04.753
Ultimately,

375
00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:05.644
you know,

376
00:19:05.722 --> 00:19:08.847
Guido was the inventor of the language and...

377
00:19:09.078 --> 00:19:10.539
The final decider about,

378
00:19:10.601 --> 00:19:10.780
yes,

379
00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:13.163
this is going to make it in, or this is not going to make it in?

380
00:19:13.324 --> 00:19:18.527
I think I developed my own style during those first years.

381
00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:21.074
All ideas are welcome,

382
00:19:21.574 --> 00:19:26.863
but I will choose which ideas I believe are right to add to the language.

383
00:19:27.644 --> 00:19:37.941
There's dozens and dozens of aspects of Python today where somebody had a vision for, if you just

384
00:19:38.262 --> 00:19:39.523
add this to Python,

385
00:19:40.125 --> 00:19:48.856
Look at all these amazing things that I can do.

386
00:19:48.857 --> 00:19:50.678
I'm one of the many people that came to Python,

387
00:19:50.692 --> 00:19:51.513
not as a programmer,

388
00:19:51.553 --> 00:19:52.513
but as a scientist.

389
00:19:52.756 --> 00:19:54.873
Python wasn't the first language I used for science.

390
00:19:55.045 --> 00:19:57.045
I was doing satellite data processing,

391
00:19:57.576 --> 00:19:58.685
and I used Perl to do it.

392
00:19:58.810 --> 00:19:59.670
And then, a year later,

393
00:19:59.685 --> 00:20:01.420
I would come back and try to figure out what I'd done,

394
00:20:01.421 --> 00:20:02.185
and I had no idea.

395
00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:04.717
Python had the opposite experience.

396
00:20:04.748 --> 00:20:06.653
I first started using Python in 1997.

397
00:20:07.191 --> 00:20:08.971
I just used it to do some scripting,

398
00:20:08.972 --> 00:20:11.236
do some data processing with some medical imaging data.

399
00:20:11.736 --> 00:20:12.095
And I was like,

400
00:20:12.096 --> 00:20:12.196
hey,

401
00:20:12.198 --> 00:20:12.736
this is nice.

402
00:20:12.737 --> 00:20:13.715
This is pretty cool.

403
00:20:13.959 --> 00:20:14.657
A year later,

404
00:20:14.659 --> 00:20:15.782
so 1998,

405
00:20:16.056 --> 00:20:18.939
I came back to look at the code I'd written and I could read it.

406
00:20:19.025 --> 00:20:20.001
I understood what I did.

407
00:20:20.603 --> 00:20:21.548
And that was kind of,

408
00:20:21.548 --> 00:20:21.782
for me,

409
00:20:21.806 --> 00:20:23.142
the convincing data that said,

410
00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:23.345
oh,

411
00:20:23.392 --> 00:20:24.704
I need to dig in on this language.

412
00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:32.048
And there were a few really key people at that time who were publishing or talking about how to use Python for science.

413
00:20:32.079 --> 00:20:32.611
Not very many,

414
00:20:32.689 --> 00:20:33.079
but a few.

415
00:20:33.564 --> 00:20:35.173
Conrad Hinson was one of them.

416
00:20:35.204 --> 00:20:35.579
I remember,

417
00:20:35.673 --> 00:20:36.798
and David Asher and...

418
00:20:37.406 --> 00:20:37.547
Jim,

419
00:20:37.626 --> 00:20:38.147
you're going to add?

420
00:20:38.788 --> 00:20:52.540
There's been a number of stages in the lifecycle of Python when it just grew from a core language capability to a platform with a number of different specialty modules and packages. That made it very,

421
00:20:52.604 --> 00:20:55.611
very useful for certain user communities.

422
00:20:56.268 --> 00:20:58.893
The first one was probably the numeric community,

423
00:20:59.221 --> 00:21:03.611
the science and engineering folks that wanted high-performance matrix operations to be done.

424
00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:06.453
Even though Guido wasn't a scientist himself,

425
00:21:06.534 --> 00:21:11.078
wasn't necessarily deeply concerned with the same things that we were concerned with as scientists,

426
00:21:11.477 --> 00:21:13.680
he was open to the suggestions.

427
00:21:16.563 --> 00:21:31.031
I think one of the things that people don't appreciate about the Python language as much now that it's so popular and mainstream, is how important it was. That Guido was open to new ideas and open to the needs of people who are not traditional programmers.

428
00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:35.074
I think he had a very clear-eyed,

429
00:21:35.613 --> 00:21:42.741
quiet focus on understanding some things about the future that he built into the language.

430
00:21:42.819 --> 00:21:45.461
It was uniquely suited to its environment.

431
00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:46.405
One of the reasons...

432
00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:47.172
I used Python.

433
00:21:47.173 --> 00:21:48.912
And I think a lot of people used Python at the time.

434
00:21:48.993 --> 00:21:49.253
Instead,

435
00:21:49.273 --> 00:21:50.234
in the early 2000s,

436
00:21:50.795 --> 00:21:52.498
the world was almost divided into,

437
00:21:52.979 --> 00:21:54.159
here's an open source ecosystem,

438
00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:55.759
or you can go and use Java,

439
00:21:55.962 --> 00:21:57.823
which is actually a paid thing.

440
00:21:58.159 --> 00:21:59.221
I was using MATLAB.

441
00:21:59.462 --> 00:22:02.893
I really didn't like the fact that when I wrote code and I wanted to share that code with others,

442
00:22:02.923 --> 00:22:09.159
I was essentially telling people. They had to go buy a license for a software package before they could even look at my code or use my code.

443
00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:09.487
You know,

444
00:22:09.488 --> 00:22:14.721
these are the days where you have to buy the developer tools or spend a couple hundred bucks to get.

445
00:22:14.906 --> 00:22:22.229
Visual Studio 6.0. And then Python, and then all of these libraries were open source and then could be used in a commercial project.

446
00:22:22.388 --> 00:22:37.685
I was sort of early on convinced by community members that Python being open source and the particular way it was open source was very important. So that people would feel comfortable using Python to make great

447
00:22:37.826 --> 00:22:40.499
things that they would then be able to sell.

448
00:22:52.412 --> 00:22:56.037
In 1998, Blender was published on the internet.

449
00:22:56.795 --> 00:22:59.803
The software was free and you could buy some things around it.

450
00:23:00.684 --> 00:23:03.724
We were restricted to use open source,

451
00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:05.990
so you didn't have a lot of options.

452
00:23:06.584 --> 00:23:09.270
We were doing a call on our website like,

453
00:23:09.317 --> 00:23:13.334
what is the most popular scripting language that we should add in Blender?

454
00:23:14.027 --> 00:23:15.568
Perl was really big,

455
00:23:16.348 --> 00:23:18.231
and Python was upcoming,

456
00:23:18.353 --> 00:23:19.250
and there were some others.

457
00:23:19.711 --> 00:23:26.981
And it was interesting to see that everybody who was advising us to use perl as scripting language,

458
00:23:27.419 --> 00:23:31.005
but they only advertised how great perl is.

459
00:23:31.786 --> 00:23:35.661
And the people who came more from the Python background,

460
00:23:36.067 --> 00:23:36.411
who said,

461
00:23:36.442 --> 00:23:36.583
well,

462
00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:38.473
I think Python is the baddest choice,

463
00:23:38.958 --> 00:23:40.880
they came with a balanced opinion.

464
00:23:40.895 --> 00:23:41.286
And they said,

465
00:23:41.348 --> 00:23:41.551
okay.

466
00:23:41.767 --> 00:23:45.871
Perl will give you this and this and this, and Python will give you other things.

467
00:23:46.433 --> 00:23:48.094
And balancing all of it,

468
00:23:48.172 --> 00:23:50.394
I would recommend you to do Python.

469
00:23:50.738 --> 00:23:53.675
And only for that reason I picked Python.

470
00:23:54.457 --> 00:23:56.082
Just because the people were nicer.

471
00:24:04.394 --> 00:24:04.785
It was...

472
00:24:05.242 --> 00:24:05.542
Honestly,

473
00:24:05.623 --> 00:24:06.765
just a lot of enthusiasts.

474
00:24:06.984 --> 00:24:09.185
It was a lot of people who just enjoyed the language,

475
00:24:09.507 --> 00:24:11.029
enjoyed the people involved with the language,

476
00:24:11.351 --> 00:24:14.671
And it would just happen to be typically motivating enough for people to want to help out.

477
00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:15.976
Ultimately,

478
00:24:16.054 --> 00:24:18.771
there's a sense of fun that comes across,

479
00:24:18.857 --> 00:24:18.976
and

480
00:24:19.476 --> 00:24:22.085
Guido coded that into the name of the language,

481
00:24:22.413 --> 00:24:23.101
influenced by

482
00:24:23.538 --> 00:24:24.257
Monty Python.

483
00:24:25.257 --> 00:24:27.679
It creates a sense of community to have your little jokes.

484
00:24:30.771 --> 00:24:31.585
Tim Peters is...

485
00:24:32.282 --> 00:24:52.105
Famous early example and blending both like the the aesthetics of Python and humor, Tim Peters was this mythical feature creature in the world of Python. And no one had met him. He was out there in the Ether as a wise one to give us advice on what to do with numerical processing. Steve

486
00:24:52.121 --> 00:24:55.433
Majeski sent me some email telling me about Python.

487
00:24:56.303 --> 00:25:00.669
So I started an email correspondence with Guido about the language and about the design,

488
00:25:00.867 --> 00:25:06.997
And I got some of the pre-release code and played with it and talked to him about design decisions and liked it very much.

489
00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:09.497
Tim Peters was a

490
00:25:09.973 --> 00:25:17.200
Python contributor and community member and mentor to me from very early on.

491
00:25:17.387 --> 00:25:19.137
Tim was a channeler of Guido.

492
00:25:19.262 --> 00:25:22.200
He had a really unique way of saying,

493
00:25:22.481 --> 00:25:23.872
I think Guido's going to like this,

494
00:25:24.012 --> 00:25:25.747
or I don't think Guido's going to like that.

495
00:25:25.942 --> 00:25:27.944
There's a poem called The Zen of Python,

496
00:25:28.184 --> 00:25:30.147
which is a partially humorous,

497
00:25:30.246 --> 00:25:35.128
partially serious poem about the aesthetics of Python.

498
00:25:35.589 --> 00:25:37.292
I'm actually looking at the

499
00:25:37.652 --> 00:25:40.019
UseNet post where

500
00:25:40.894 --> 00:25:43.957
Tim posted his first version of the Zen of Python,

501
00:25:44.721 --> 00:25:46.660
although he called it the Way of Python.

502
00:25:47.878 --> 00:25:53.535
And it was in response to some discussion where people were complaining that...

503
00:25:53.994 --> 00:25:56.797
They didn't understand what was Python's philosophy.

504
00:25:57.617 --> 00:25:58.739
They couldn't figure me out.

505
00:25:58.917 --> 00:26:00.122
And Tim had figured me out,

506
00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:02.183
and he put it basically in poetry.

507
00:26:03.386 --> 00:26:09.230
Here is the Way of Python by Tim Peters from 1999.

508
00:26:09.231 --> 00:26:10.989
Beautiful is better than ugly.

509
00:26:11.675 --> 00:26:11.972
Duh.

510
00:26:12.692 --> 00:26:14.317
Explicit is better than implicit.

511
00:26:14.753 --> 00:26:16.457
Simple is better than complex.

512
00:26:17.003 --> 00:26:18.832
Complex is better than complicated.

513
00:26:19.722 --> 00:26:20.800
I love that distinction.

514
00:26:21.222 --> 00:26:22.847
Flat is better than nested.

515
00:26:23.366 --> 00:26:24.646
Sparse is better than dense.

516
00:26:24.906 --> 00:26:25.886
Readability counts.

517
00:26:26.186 --> 00:26:27.547
I will say it counts for a lot.

518
00:26:28.308 --> 00:26:32.269
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.

519
00:26:32.511 --> 00:26:34.511
Although practicality beats purity,

520
00:26:35.027 --> 00:26:38.886
errors should never pass silently unless explicitly silenced.

521
00:26:39.394 --> 00:26:40.785
In the face of ambiguity,

522
00:26:41.566 --> 00:26:43.207
refuse the temptation to guess.

523
00:26:43.925 --> 00:26:46.035
I did not follow that in a very...

524
00:26:46.522 --> 00:26:47.785
Key piece of NumPy,

525
00:26:48.365 --> 00:26:49.385
and it's still a mess.

526
00:26:49.885 --> 00:26:51.067
There should be one,

527
00:26:51.287 --> 00:26:53.228
and preferably only one,

528
00:26:53.709 --> 00:26:55.170
obvious way to do it.

529
00:26:55.912 --> 00:27:00.395
That's a direct reference to Perl's motto of There's more than one way to do it,

530
00:27:00.434 --> 00:27:00.817
by the way.

531
00:27:01.201 --> 00:27:03.084
Although that may not be obvious at first,

532
00:27:03.255 --> 00:27:04.020
unless you're Dutch.

533
00:27:05.287 --> 00:27:06.240
Now is better than never,

534
00:27:06.442 --> 00:27:08.630
although never is often better than right now.

535
00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:10.787
If the implementation is hard to explain,

536
00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:11.834
it's a bad idea.

537
00:27:12.145 --> 00:27:13.209
That's a really good one.

538
00:27:13.663 --> 00:27:16.303
If the implementation is easy to explain,

539
00:27:16.542 --> 00:27:17.863
it may be a good idea.

540
00:27:18.285 --> 00:27:18.605
Names,

541
00:27:18.663 --> 00:27:20.683
faces are one honking great idea.

542
00:27:21.003 --> 00:27:22.167
Let's do more of those.

543
00:27:22.503 --> 00:27:23.441
This is so, Tim.

544
00:27:25.527 --> 00:27:25.925
Normally,

545
00:27:26.363 --> 00:27:27.308
import this print,

546
00:27:27.746 --> 00:27:30.167
import some useful library,

547
00:27:30.246 --> 00:27:31.792
which is very serious business.

548
00:27:32.246 --> 00:27:38.261
Having an import, this that was just a joke, was a bit of lightness that we like to add.

549
00:27:38.667 --> 00:27:39.574
This is from a small.

550
00:27:40.434 --> 00:27:41.236
Obvious community,

551
00:27:41.375 --> 00:27:41.557
right?

552
00:27:41.596 --> 00:27:44.657
Because if you're a corporate behemoth making a programming language,

553
00:27:44.678 --> 00:27:49.240
like, someone's probably going to tell you that you can't put a silly poem in your programming language.

554
00:27:49.263 --> 00:27:49.381
But

555
00:27:50.521 --> 00:27:52.748
Python is just made by dogs on the internet,

556
00:27:52.826 --> 00:27:54.849
so they can put poems in their software.

557
00:27:58.232 --> 00:28:01.857
The different ways to make money on the internet are just beginning to emerge.

558
00:28:02.482 --> 00:28:06.373
Entrepreneurs are putting their faith in a new medium to deliver the big payoff.

559
00:28:07.013 --> 00:28:08.045
It's a dot-com bubble.

560
00:28:08.207 --> 00:28:12.611
All this money pumping into Silicon Valley software and internet stuff.

561
00:28:12.951 --> 00:28:14.032
Early 2000,

562
00:28:14.115 --> 00:28:16.919
I decided to leave CNRI and,

563
00:28:17.076 --> 00:28:18.498
with a few co-workers,

564
00:28:19.278 --> 00:28:21.584
joined a little startup named BeOpen.

565
00:28:23.162 --> 00:28:23.865
While CNRI,

566
00:28:23.903 --> 00:28:24.137
I think,

567
00:28:24.138 --> 00:28:26.826
was an amazing home for Python in the early days,

568
00:28:27.201 --> 00:28:29.044
everything changes and everything evolves.

569
00:28:29.123 --> 00:28:29.731
And thinking,

570
00:28:29.981 --> 00:28:30.153
well,

571
00:28:30.169 --> 00:28:32.076
if we're going to strike out on our own,

572
00:28:32.373 --> 00:28:34.106
this is probably the right time to do that.

573
00:28:34.419 --> 00:28:36.106
That didn't work out.

574
00:28:36.919 --> 00:28:39.098
I'd say within maybe a year or something.

575
00:28:39.239 --> 00:28:41.941
Be open was completely incompetent.

576
00:28:42.382 --> 00:28:46.323
We spent the summer in blissful ignorance, working full-time on Python.

577
00:28:46.901 --> 00:28:49.260
We built and released Python 2.

578
00:28:49.784 --> 00:28:51.502
And within five months,

579
00:28:51.698 --> 00:28:52.299
it was over.

580
00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:54.588
We were paid our salaries every two weeks.

581
00:28:55.135 --> 00:28:58.198
And then suddenly, in late October,

582
00:28:58.230 --> 00:28:58.744
we weren't.

583
00:29:01.385 --> 00:29:04.526
It was a moment where the shit could have hit the fan.

584
00:29:05.199 --> 00:29:07.820
If all the Python guys went their separate ways,

585
00:29:08.041 --> 00:29:10.644
Python wasn't big enough to survive that at the time.

586
00:29:12.507 --> 00:29:13.851
That was when I had a company,

587
00:29:13.943 --> 00:29:15.029
Digital Creations,

588
00:29:15.068 --> 00:29:16.146
that later became Zobe.

589
00:29:16.249 --> 00:29:17.515
Which is an application server,

590
00:29:17.554 --> 00:29:18.210
database server,

591
00:29:18.271 --> 00:29:18.936
index server,

592
00:29:19.015 --> 00:29:19.576
web server,

593
00:29:19.632 --> 00:29:19.796
etc.

594
00:29:20.374 --> 00:29:21.468
Very large-scale,

595
00:29:21.811 --> 00:29:24.576
commercial-quality application written in Python.

596
00:29:24.811 --> 00:29:26.201
And if Python died,

597
00:29:26.326 --> 00:29:27.499
you know, who else would die?

598
00:29:28.124 --> 00:29:28.843
We'd die.

599
00:29:28.982 --> 00:29:31.249
The whole platform was built on Python,

600
00:29:31.343 --> 00:29:33.061
so they were Python experts.

601
00:29:33.326 --> 00:29:33.874
We need to go...

602
00:29:34.398 --> 00:29:41.045
And make sure that Python is secure for the future and that the team stays together.

603
00:29:41.506 --> 00:29:46.551
So we negotiated an agreement with them to join my company.

604
00:29:47.067 --> 00:29:49.973
That was an incredibly lucky rescue.

605
00:29:50.192 --> 00:29:56.373
We felt like we really trusted them and we believed in what they were doing and what they wanted to do with Python and for Python.

606
00:29:56.653 --> 00:29:59.528
This is a place that I'm proud of.

607
00:29:59.670 --> 00:30:00.387
In hindsight,

608
00:30:00.388 --> 00:30:02.670
it was a really critical point in Python's life.

609
00:30:02.684 --> 00:30:03.809
I think if we had chosen

610
00:30:04.095 --> 00:30:06.220
wrong or try to say,

611
00:30:06.338 --> 00:30:06.460
oh,

612
00:30:06.461 --> 00:30:06.599
well,

613
00:30:06.601 --> 00:30:08.362
we'll just strike out on our own anyway.

614
00:30:09.404 --> 00:30:09.987
You never know.

615
00:30:10.166 --> 00:30:14.651
But I'm not so sure that Python would have survived that juncture in its life.

616
00:30:15.315 --> 00:30:15.494
Yeah.

617
00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:39.413
Python just kept sort of growing and the community kept self-organizing.

618
00:30:40.151 --> 00:30:40.510
One of the,

619
00:30:40.632 --> 00:30:40.932
I think,

620
00:30:41.034 --> 00:30:43.232
underlying themes of Python,

621
00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:45.593
if you take it in its totality,

622
00:30:46.529 --> 00:30:49.718
is this sense of grassroots movements.

623
00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:57.257
Things grow from the bottom up and evolve to the point where everybody sort of realizes,

624
00:30:57.382 --> 00:30:57.490
oh,

625
00:30:57.491 --> 00:30:58.835
we need a little bit more structure.

626
00:30:59.396 --> 00:30:59.615
Oh,

627
00:30:59.616 --> 00:31:01.335
the Python software Foundation.

628
00:31:01.757 --> 00:31:02.599
In my opinion.

629
00:31:02.967 --> 00:31:03.707
The PSF,

630
00:31:03.767 --> 00:31:06.167
that damn thing, was a success from day one.

631
00:31:06.667 --> 00:31:11.628
That came out of one of the concerns we had had with BOpen,

632
00:31:11.785 --> 00:31:12.207
actually.

633
00:31:12.589 --> 00:31:17.808
So CNRI had written a license for Python and put his name on it.

634
00:31:18.847 --> 00:31:24.292
And Bopen had copied a version of that license and put the Bopen name on it.

635
00:31:25.449 --> 00:31:31.136
There was a concern that at some point, I might accidentally end up working for a company that

636
00:31:31.375 --> 00:31:33.676
try to grab ownership of Python.

637
00:31:33.897 --> 00:31:38.421
We realize that we really need an organization that will be independent,

638
00:31:39.042 --> 00:31:44.846
will not be beholden to any company and their whims and their lawyers,

639
00:31:45.667 --> 00:31:46.432
and will really

640
00:31:46.674 --> 00:31:46.954
keep

641
00:31:47.775 --> 00:31:52.875
Python users as their first and foremost customer,

642
00:31:53.316 --> 00:31:53.836
so to speak,

643
00:31:53.897 --> 00:31:54.457
in mind.

644
00:31:58.777 --> 00:32:03.003
And then the magic happened when we got into PyCon,

645
00:32:03.644 --> 00:32:06.925
which is maybe the third stool of the miracle of Python.

646
00:32:18.011 --> 00:32:19.834
What are your takeaways from

647
00:32:21.694 --> 00:32:22.675
U.S. To Seattle?

648
00:32:22.676 --> 00:32:25.496
It feels like people are still willing to go do hard things,

649
00:32:25.582 --> 00:32:26.722
work on things together,

650
00:32:26.902 --> 00:32:27.222
you know?

651
00:32:27.644 --> 00:32:29.121
They still do have the passion,

652
00:32:29.183 --> 00:32:29.800
to be honest.

653
00:32:29.941 --> 00:32:32.144
So what was it for you?

654
00:32:32.269 --> 00:32:32.527
For me,

655
00:32:32.644 --> 00:32:36.011
most definitely like meeting people I haven't met in a while.

656
00:32:36.136 --> 00:32:36.683
That's cool.

657
00:32:37.136 --> 00:32:39.199
And just pretty much hanging out with them.

658
00:32:39.355 --> 00:32:40.214
You try to walk.

659
00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:40.871
Yeah.

660
00:32:41.027 --> 00:32:41.792
So the other side,

661
00:32:41.949 --> 00:32:44.324
there's like 10 people that you want to see in between.

662
00:32:45.528 --> 00:32:45.769
Like,

663
00:32:45.769 --> 00:32:46.028
stop,

664
00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:47.990
I want to talk to you.

665
00:32:47.991 --> 00:32:48.029
Oh,

666
00:32:48.030 --> 00:32:48.190
I know.

667
00:32:48.191 --> 00:32:49.851
Pablo and Yuri presented as bananas.

668
00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:53.838
And then Lukasz asked a question, dressed as a banana.

669
00:32:54.479 --> 00:32:56.815
And then Guido came in, dressed as a banana as well.

670
00:32:57.057 --> 00:32:58.698
Thank you for what you do for the PSO.

671
00:32:59.479 --> 00:33:01.260
Please don't step down.

672
00:33:01.307 --> 00:33:02.260
Just keep doing it forever.

673
00:33:03.869 --> 00:33:04.088
You're great.

674
00:33:04.089 --> 00:33:09.573
Raise your hand if you have done.

675
00:33:09.635 --> 00:33:10.276
React for this.

676
00:33:12.522 --> 00:33:20.814
Raise your hand if you would like to come back.

677
00:33:20.815 --> 00:33:20.867
No,

678
00:33:20.868 --> 00:33:21.314
come back to Python.

679
00:33:21.595 --> 00:33:21.814
All right,

680
00:33:21.815 --> 00:33:21.953
good.

681
00:33:21.954 --> 00:33:22.375
For the record,

682
00:33:22.376 --> 00:33:22.914
100%.

683
00:33:22.953 --> 00:33:24.814
I begged my mother to take me to

684
00:33:25.939 --> 00:33:27.117
PyCon, and

685
00:33:27.642 --> 00:33:29.298
I met all my online heroes.

686
00:33:29.736 --> 00:33:31.439
He was this distant,

687
00:33:31.689 --> 00:33:35.000
benevolent dictator for life who I had been talking to over the internet,

688
00:33:35.078 --> 00:33:36.673
but here he was in person,

689
00:33:36.906 --> 00:33:40.470
and so I was thrilled to be able to finally meet him.

690
00:33:40.967 --> 00:33:43.269
Then I think everyone was aware that he was a

691
00:33:43.729 --> 00:33:45.854
15-year-old kid on the other end of that terminal.

692
00:33:46.631 --> 00:33:49.198
When PYCon was held in Montreal,

693
00:33:49.534 --> 00:33:54.784
the organizer asked me if I'd be willing to give an opening address to the conference.

694
00:33:55.259 --> 00:33:55.518
Well,

695
00:33:55.823 --> 00:33:57.276
I'm a slightly fast talker,

696
00:33:57.729 --> 00:33:59.729
and I had some spare time.

697
00:34:00.073 --> 00:34:02.462
And I just used it as an opportunity to say thank you.

698
00:34:02.776 --> 00:34:04.604
I like to think of it as I came for the language,

699
00:34:04.634 --> 00:34:05.932
but I stayed for the community.

700
00:34:06.073 --> 00:34:09.728
So I want to personally thank all of you for making this such a wonderful.

701
00:34:09.947 --> 00:34:12.528
Place to be and such a wonderful group of people to be around.

702
00:34:12.971 --> 00:34:13.690
So thank you.

703
00:34:14.570 --> 00:34:14.851
Luckily,

704
00:34:14.851 --> 00:34:15.594
it came off well,

705
00:34:15.594 --> 00:34:16.952
because people still quote it.

706
00:34:17.195 --> 00:34:21.257
I think it kind of speaks to the core ethos of Python.

707
00:34:21.554 --> 00:34:27.023
We try to develop this tool that people can use for their needs to get their work done.

708
00:34:27.742 --> 00:34:31.273
But the community is the true strength of Python.

709
00:34:31.414 --> 00:34:32.507
It's not just the language,

710
00:34:32.695 --> 00:34:32.882
right?

711
00:34:33.023 --> 00:34:33.726
It's the people.

712
00:34:39.682 --> 00:34:41.603
It was steadily growing every single year.

713
00:34:41.903 --> 00:34:43.764
It was getting more and more downloads,

714
00:34:43.923 --> 00:34:46.103
more and more people making use of it.

715
00:34:46.443 --> 00:34:57.528
It became a more sophisticated language that was fit to purpose for this new, emerging programming paradigm, where the web itself is the platform.

716
00:34:57.748 --> 00:35:06.467
He told me an interesting number that made me realize that the Python user community was already much bigger than I had estimated.

717
00:35:07.451 --> 00:35:08.248
Because, he said...

718
00:35:09.014 --> 00:35:09.255
Guido,

719
00:35:09.434 --> 00:35:12.496
you don't know the sales numbers for Python books,

720
00:35:12.858 --> 00:35:14.161
but I am Tim O'Reilly.

721
00:35:14.239 --> 00:35:16.521
I published the two most important ones,

722
00:35:17.121 --> 00:35:18.927
and I do know the sales numbers,

723
00:35:19.427 --> 00:35:20.849
and they are fantastic.

724
00:35:21.771 --> 00:35:24.590
I don't know if he had that much enthusiasm in his voice then,

725
00:35:24.653 --> 00:35:29.309
but he was sharing this new-to-me important fact,

726
00:35:29.856 --> 00:35:30.856
which made me realize,

727
00:35:30.903 --> 00:35:31.012
oh,

728
00:35:31.121 --> 00:35:31.451
gosh.

729
00:35:32.684 --> 00:35:37.887
Python tends to get spikes when certain specialties,

730
00:35:37.903 --> 00:35:38.528
I guess, you could say.

731
00:35:38.882 --> 00:35:43.646
Pick the language up and decide that this is a thing that they want to use in their area.

732
00:35:44.128 --> 00:35:47.010
Everybody wanted to do things with the world wide Web,

733
00:35:47.831 --> 00:35:48.072
and

734
00:35:48.456 --> 00:35:54.260
Python actually became a really powerful platform for doing not just web pages,

735
00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:56.494
but web servers and services.

736
00:35:57.353 --> 00:36:00.166
Suddenly, we had an increase of people coming in from the web world.

737
00:36:06.775 --> 00:36:12.760
I think Dropbox was one of the early companies to start building in Python and reaching millions of users.

738
00:36:14.182 --> 00:36:14.726
My name's Drew,

739
00:36:15.085 --> 00:36:16.789
and I'll be showing you a quick tour of Dropbox,

740
00:36:17.467 --> 00:36:19.351
which is a new way to store and share files online.

741
00:36:19.648 --> 00:36:23.898
Python had been largely viewed as scripting language. You run on the back end,

742
00:36:23.898 --> 00:36:25.632
or maybe in an academic setting,

743
00:36:25.679 --> 00:36:27.210
or in a scientific setting,

744
00:36:27.335 --> 00:36:31.257
but not really for production desktop software that you'd ship to millions of people.

745
00:36:32.298 --> 00:36:36.485
I just started writing in Python and hoping that none of the roadblocks would completely blow me up.

746
00:36:36.925 --> 00:36:42.375
You can develop programs much faster in Python because it's a higher level language, and it's a very clean,

747
00:36:42.594 --> 00:36:43.398
easy language.

748
00:36:43.539 --> 00:36:45.907
And so we could be a lot more competitive.

749
00:36:46.530 --> 00:36:50.635
And other companies who were writing with Java or C++ or Perl.

750
00:36:51.034 --> 00:36:51.494
Even back then,

751
00:36:51.494 --> 00:36:55.056
we were competing against the Googles and Microsofts of the world,

752
00:36:55.079 --> 00:36:58.025
and our odds didn't seem very good,

753
00:36:58.041 --> 00:36:59.385
so we needed all the help we can get.

754
00:36:59.626 --> 00:37:01.463
Google had this big team,

755
00:37:01.525 --> 00:37:02.487
like 100 people,

756
00:37:02.579 --> 00:37:03.954
C++ programmers,

757
00:37:04.001 --> 00:37:05.954
trying to do a video hosting site.

758
00:37:05.971 --> 00:37:09.126
And they could never keep up with this little thing over there called YouTube.

759
00:37:09.626 --> 00:37:10.534
And they went and looked.

760
00:37:10.534 --> 00:37:12.737
It was just a couple of people writing Python.

761
00:37:13.362 --> 00:37:14.159
Python ended up being...

762
00:37:14.978 --> 00:37:37.277
A big force multiplier on our effort. And no other language that we considered had anything close to that kind of capability. In fact, the data science suddenly became a thing that you had to do. Combined with the fact that Python was sort of well positioned to

763
00:37:37.293 --> 00:37:43.246
do data science stuff, meant a huge amount of new Python users floating

764
00:37:50.155 --> 00:37:54.559
what was starting to happen. In the 2009-2010 time frame,

765
00:37:54.981 --> 00:37:59.242
we were seeing more and more of our consulting deals tied to using

766
00:37:59.782 --> 00:38:04.007
Python. Not as really a replacement for Matlab or engineering type things,

767
00:38:04.547 --> 00:38:07.710
but using Python for doing data processing.

768
00:38:08.492 --> 00:38:09.835
We didn't call it data science at the time,

769
00:38:09.898 --> 00:38:11.039
but it was that kind of work,

770
00:38:11.148 --> 00:38:11.289
right?

771
00:38:11.289 --> 00:38:12.523
It was modeling, predictive analytics,

772
00:38:12.525 --> 00:38:13.039
things like that.

773
00:38:13.429 --> 00:38:14.585
This is the time of Hadoop,

774
00:38:14.632 --> 00:38:15.554
the time of big data,

775
00:38:15.664 --> 00:38:16.835
the time of Spark,

776
00:38:16.882 --> 00:38:18.726
and people were doing java at scale.

777
00:38:19.126 --> 00:38:22.630
We were starting to do much more consulting work in the financial industry.

778
00:38:22.871 --> 00:38:24.891
And we'd walk into these large,

779
00:38:25.172 --> 00:38:26.574
very well-capitalized firms,

780
00:38:26.594 --> 00:38:28.757
and they were using Python to do business data processing.

781
00:38:29.039 --> 00:38:29.500
I realized,

782
00:38:29.539 --> 00:38:29.735
okay,

783
00:38:29.797 --> 00:38:32.742
if it's a research group over here doing some science research,

784
00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:33.577
and they don't have money,

785
00:38:33.625 --> 00:38:34.719
and they use an open source thing,

786
00:38:35.202 --> 00:38:35.610
I get it.

787
00:38:35.797 --> 00:38:37.469
But if you have J.P. Morgan,

788
00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:37.969
right,

789
00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:39.594
which has a lot of money,

790
00:38:40.266 --> 00:38:42.516
and they're picking up and using these scientific tools,

791
00:38:42.547 --> 00:38:43.344
and they're loving it,

792
00:38:43.547 --> 00:38:46.110
I realized that we didn't just have a cheap,

793
00:38:46.469 --> 00:38:47.360
free alternative.

794
00:38:47.755 --> 00:38:52.099
We actually had something that was innovative and that was doing something fairly unique.

795
00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:56.007
Peter and I ended up leaving and starting another company.

796
00:38:56.764 --> 00:38:58.342
We started as continuum Analytics,

797
00:38:58.507 --> 00:38:58.865
actually,

798
00:38:59.545 --> 00:39:06.248
and its vision was to scale Numpy and Pandas to large datasets and large clusters.

799
00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:08.248
We quickly ran into a simple problem.

800
00:39:08.670 --> 00:39:09.655
Very quickly in.

801
00:39:09.842 --> 00:39:10.842
But a very annoying problem.

802
00:39:11.061 --> 00:39:11.280
Yes.

803
00:39:11.577 --> 00:39:14.764
People just couldn't even install the software needed to run all this Python stuff.

804
00:39:16.735 --> 00:39:21.438
The thing about the Python scientific and data stack is that all of these different libraries,

805
00:39:21.842 --> 00:39:23.641
they're very different than the web development libraries,

806
00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:27.262
Because these data libraries are often backed by a very large amount of complex C++,

807
00:39:27.545 --> 00:39:28.045
Fortran,

808
00:39:28.427 --> 00:39:29.670
other kinds of software modules.

809
00:39:29.989 --> 00:39:33.036
And to build those correctly takes some work.

810
00:39:33.536 --> 00:39:36.958
To build them correctly on every operating system takes even more work.

811
00:39:37.333 --> 00:39:40.677
And then to build them so that they can actually be connected together,

812
00:39:40.943 --> 00:39:43.239
that requires you to have this entire build system.

813
00:39:43.998 --> 00:39:44.659
rationalized.

814
00:39:44.699 --> 00:39:49.202
And so the very first thing we did was like, make a distribution of Python to make it easy to get that installed.

815
00:39:49.362 --> 00:39:51.188
A lot of the data science Python people,

816
00:39:51.246 --> 00:39:52.692
they didn't even use normal Python.

817
00:39:52.706 --> 00:39:54.371
They used this Anaconda Python distribution.

818
00:39:54.612 --> 00:39:56.612
Sort of a dumb joke that I came up with at one point.

819
00:39:56.731 --> 00:39:58.175
It was basically Python for big data.

820
00:39:58.512 --> 00:39:59.317
So it's a big snake,

821
00:39:59.318 --> 00:39:59.909
so Anaconda.

822
00:40:01.817 --> 00:40:03.331
After, like a few years,

823
00:40:03.737 --> 00:40:07.817
we kept going to conferences and going to places and people wouldn't know who we were.

824
00:40:07.925 --> 00:40:10.067
But the instant that we mentioned that we make Anaconda,

825
00:40:10.472 --> 00:40:10.862
they would say,

826
00:40:10.925 --> 00:40:11.206
Oh yeah,

827
00:40:11.208 --> 00:40:11.567
of course,

828
00:40:11.581 --> 00:40:12.206
I love Anaconda.

829
00:40:12.222 --> 00:40:12.831
I use it all the time,

830
00:40:12.862 --> 00:40:13.003
right?

831
00:40:13.378 --> 00:40:14.460
So after that happened,

832
00:40:14.639 --> 00:40:15.539
like the thousands of times,

833
00:40:15.541 --> 00:40:15.760
we said,

834
00:40:15.802 --> 00:40:15.961
okay,

835
00:40:16.001 --> 00:40:17.583
maybe we should rename the company Anaconda.

836
00:40:17.864 --> 00:40:22.289
Data engineering became a discipline where Python was incredibly entrenched.

837
00:40:22.469 --> 00:40:23.228
It was Python and

838
00:40:23.572 --> 00:40:23.688
R.

839
00:40:24.391 --> 00:40:26.094
And over time,

840
00:40:26.650 --> 00:40:31.978
Python's data analysis libraries caught up, and plotting libraries and stuff started to catch up to what R had.

841
00:40:32.603 --> 00:40:33.414
And then people realized,

842
00:40:33.525 --> 00:40:33.664
oh,

843
00:40:33.806 --> 00:40:33.992
well,

844
00:40:34.039 --> 00:40:34.664
With Python,

845
00:40:34.697 --> 00:40:37.242
I can work end-to-end with my data. Versus

846
00:40:37.806 --> 00:40:39.978
R. Being very good at data analysis,

847
00:40:40.009 --> 00:40:42.322
but not necessarily like the data collection stage.

848
00:40:42.492 --> 00:40:42.914
Various other

849
00:40:43.523 --> 00:40:43.963
stages.

850
00:40:44.483 --> 00:40:46.905
I remember going to a Python conference at one point and I was like,

851
00:40:46.967 --> 00:40:49.427
there's so many science-y people here.

852
00:40:49.907 --> 00:40:51.208
Like, where are all the web developers?

853
00:40:51.210 --> 00:40:52.916
This is all data, pipelines and stuff.

854
00:40:53.072 --> 00:40:56.157
I don't want to be modest about this because it was a collective effort for the whole community.

855
00:40:56.619 --> 00:40:58.657
But I think that what we did at Anaconda,

856
00:40:58.775 --> 00:41:02.822
not only making the software installer that made it one click for people to just run,

857
00:41:02.963 --> 00:41:07.369
but also shepherding the conferences and building that community and whatnot was really critical.

858
00:41:07.541 --> 00:41:11.494
They were incredibly important contributions.

859
00:41:11.666 --> 00:41:12.775
I think we actually, Hmm.

860
00:41:13.123 --> 00:41:14.585
Made Python super popular.

861
00:41:15.164 --> 00:41:15.724
I think we did.

862
00:41:24.652 --> 00:41:24.817
Well,

863
00:41:24.833 --> 00:41:29.434
I remember hearing from a friend of mine that Guido van Rossum was just working at Google.

864
00:41:30.621 --> 00:41:30.902
And that,

865
00:41:31.965 --> 00:41:32.465
when I thought about it,

866
00:41:32.467 --> 00:41:32.637
I'm like,

867
00:41:32.637 --> 00:41:33.027
wait,

868
00:41:33.028 --> 00:41:33.137
yeah,

869
00:41:33.215 --> 00:41:33.449
Guido,

870
00:41:33.996 --> 00:41:34.371
I guess,

871
00:41:34.684 --> 00:41:37.059
works at a normal company.

872
00:41:37.246 --> 00:41:40.043
And I can't remember the exact circumstances,

873
00:41:40.045 --> 00:41:40.637
but I think either

874
00:41:41.271 --> 00:41:42.612
I got an introduction to him,

875
00:41:42.853 --> 00:41:43.452
or I just maybe,

876
00:41:43.454 --> 00:41:44.914
I think they just sent him an email saying,

877
00:41:44.934 --> 00:41:45.155
hey,

878
00:41:46.635 --> 00:41:47.518
big fan of your work.

879
00:41:47.898 --> 00:41:48.898
It was like fan mail,

880
00:41:49.378 --> 00:41:49.980
basically.

881
00:41:50.338 --> 00:41:51.081
And he responded,

882
00:41:51.378 --> 00:41:52.463
and we got lunch.

883
00:41:52.878 --> 00:41:53.121
I mean,

884
00:41:53.143 --> 00:41:54.440
he's a hero of mine,

885
00:41:54.668 --> 00:41:57.253
and he was totally friendly and approachable.

886
00:41:57.581 --> 00:41:58.503
And at that talk,

887
00:41:58.505 --> 00:42:02.675
it was revealed that Dropbox was entirely written in Python,

888
00:42:02.956 --> 00:42:04.393
both the client and the server.

889
00:42:04.706 --> 00:42:05.675
And that was exciting.

890
00:42:06.034 --> 00:42:08.034
He was interested in what we were doing with Python,

891
00:42:08.081 --> 00:42:09.518
and I think we were stretching.

892
00:42:10.067 --> 00:42:12.989
The language and the runtime in interesting ways.

893
00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:14.871
He approached me again and said,

894
00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:15.472
hey,

895
00:42:15.592 --> 00:42:17.514
we would really like you to work for us.

896
00:42:17.956 --> 00:42:20.597
And then, to my surprise and delight,

897
00:42:20.699 --> 00:42:22.722
he ended up joining the Dropbox team,

898
00:42:23.237 --> 00:42:25.480
which was super exciting for all of us.

899
00:42:26.135 --> 00:42:27.465
I stayed there for seven years.

900
00:42:27.965 --> 00:42:33.293
We did more important stuff for Python than I did during seven years in Google,

901
00:42:33.307 --> 00:42:33.527
I think.

902
00:42:34.574 --> 00:42:36.840
I think he had a big impact on the rest of the team.

903
00:42:37.355 --> 00:42:39.735
Here's someone who's one of the icons of computing,

904
00:42:39.835 --> 00:42:45.414
but you would never know it from how he badges in to the office every day.

905
00:42:45.478 --> 00:42:52.181
And I think it's a really great example in terms of being super humble and curious and friendly.

906
00:42:52.961 --> 00:42:58.016
It's hard for me to think of someone who has had more impact with lower ego.

907
00:43:00.438 --> 00:43:02.860
Let's start with the first Python license plate.

908
00:43:03.925 --> 00:43:04.146
Sorry,

909
00:43:06.628 --> 00:43:08.809
that was my car where I lived in Virginia.

910
00:43:09.291 --> 00:43:12.614
And there was a box on the application.

911
00:43:13.217 --> 00:43:13.434
Sorry,

912
00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:15.217
just wear the other one, too.

913
00:43:17.123 --> 00:43:18.856
Do you want custom license plate?

914
00:43:19.201 --> 00:43:21.528
So I managed to get Python in Virginia.

915
00:43:21.778 --> 00:43:23.028
And in California,

916
00:43:23.106 --> 00:43:25.264
Python was long taken.

917
00:43:26.748 --> 00:43:29.373
Like, someone in Silicon Valley probably has a

918
00:43:29.826 --> 00:43:31.217
Python license plate somewhere.

919
00:43:32.061 --> 00:43:34.083
So the best I could get was Py3K,

920
00:43:34.324 --> 00:43:37.106
which I thought was pretty cute anyway.

921
00:43:40.313 --> 00:43:41.773
It became ever more popular.

922
00:43:42.835 --> 00:43:46.797
And people started thinking about flaws in the language.

923
00:43:47.179 --> 00:43:51.202
There were a lot of ideas floating around the core development community,

924
00:43:51.452 --> 00:43:54.688
changes you could make to the language that people thought would be major improvements.

925
00:43:54.688 --> 00:43:59.969
The only problem with them was that they would break old Python code that currently existed.

926
00:44:00.266 --> 00:44:00.735
Some of that...

927
00:44:00.958 --> 00:44:04.181
Probably got away from us a little bit, in hindsight.

928
00:44:06.664 --> 00:44:13.434
We released Python 3.0 in December of 2007.

929
00:44:13.909 --> 00:44:17.309
I remember because I was actually interning under Guido at the time.

930
00:44:17.996 --> 00:44:20.277
We were giving people roughly five years,

931
00:44:20.324 --> 00:44:20.684
I think,

932
00:44:20.731 --> 00:44:21.621
to do the transition.

933
00:44:22.246 --> 00:44:24.824
And everyone thought that was just extraordinarily generous.

934
00:44:25.121 --> 00:44:28.793
The world would totally be on Python 3 in just a few years.

935
00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:30.512
This is best for the language long term.

936
00:44:30.570 --> 00:44:31.793
We're going to make these changes.

937
00:44:31.893 --> 00:44:33.094
The community has always come along with this.

938
00:44:33.096 --> 00:44:35.074
We think they'll come along with this journey as well.

939
00:44:35.336 --> 00:44:36.836
We were very naive about that.

940
00:44:37.621 --> 00:44:38.996
And they made us know it.

941
00:44:43.387 --> 00:44:44.184
The community said,

942
00:44:44.208 --> 00:44:44.324
no,

943
00:44:44.722 --> 00:44:45.262
not worth it.

944
00:44:45.621 --> 00:44:45.887
Kill it.

945
00:44:45.965 --> 00:44:46.402
Don't do it.

946
00:44:46.746 --> 00:44:47.606
It's not going to work.

947
00:44:48.965 --> 00:44:52.434
This included some very notable individuals in the community.

948
00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:09.565
Hi,

949
00:45:09.909 --> 00:45:10.463
my name is Armin.

950
00:45:11.050 --> 00:45:14.166
You might be familiar with some of the Python libraries that I wrote,

951
00:45:14.393 --> 00:45:15.956
and you might even maybe use some of them.

952
00:45:16.706 --> 00:45:18.893
The Python 2 to Python 3 transition,

953
00:45:19.190 --> 00:45:21.878
initially, it happened very gradually over many years.

954
00:45:22.378 --> 00:45:23.675
There was the version that everybody used,

955
00:45:23.753 --> 00:45:26.159
and there was sort of the version on the side of the build that nobody used.

956
00:45:26.378 --> 00:45:28.222
People didn't want to put in the effort.

957
00:45:28.318 --> 00:45:29.978
Because their code worked.

958
00:45:30.119 --> 00:45:30.398
You know,

959
00:45:30.661 --> 00:45:31.400
why rewrite it?

960
00:45:31.402 --> 00:45:34.543
It's very hard to mix button two and three.

961
00:45:37.786 --> 00:45:39.786
It's a headache.

962
00:45:40.067 --> 00:45:41.168
So I just didn't move.

963
00:45:41.472 --> 00:45:42.269
And a lot of people did.

964
00:45:42.769 --> 00:45:45.762
It felt there's a likelihood that it will not go anywhere.

965
00:45:46.512 --> 00:45:51.918
It felt much more like a top-down decision than any of the things in the past.

966
00:45:52.481 --> 00:45:53.856
And that top-down decision,

967
00:45:54.340 --> 00:45:57.246
I think for some people, felt like it was not inclusive.

968
00:45:57.842 --> 00:46:02.626
Of the real pains of people who had a long tail of use cases.

969
00:46:03.005 --> 00:46:08.534
I think I severely underestimated how successful Python already was,

970
00:46:08.815 --> 00:46:20.338
how many people had written so much code in Python 2 that it would be hard for them to sort of put the effort into translating to Python 3.

971
00:46:20.588 --> 00:46:26.385
The most controversial thing by far was that we wanted to change the way Unicode was handled.

972
00:46:26.766 --> 00:46:30.190
A way to say these things are strings and they're human consumable,

973
00:46:30.228 --> 00:46:32.632
they're words that people want to read and write,

974
00:46:32.670 --> 00:46:33.791
and these things are bytes.

975
00:46:33.853 --> 00:46:36.494
These are things that computers want to read and write.

976
00:46:39.456 --> 00:46:44.800
We basically made all strings unicode, and we made you use a new prefix B for bytes.

977
00:46:45.487 --> 00:46:47.503
And this was incredibly disturbing.

978
00:46:47.862 --> 00:46:54.581
I was implementing a WSGI library at the time. And one of the things that you do when you implement WSGI is that you have to parse HTTP data,

979
00:46:54.612 --> 00:46:55.909
you have to parse cookie data.

980
00:46:56.458 --> 00:46:56.797
And there,

981
00:46:56.798 --> 00:46:59.300
there was always a mixture of bytes and Unicode.

982
00:46:59.681 --> 00:47:01.501
And it was very easy to work with on Python 2,

983
00:47:01.623 --> 00:47:04.244
and it was incredibly annoying to work on Python 3,

984
00:47:04.326 --> 00:47:05.447
at least initially.

985
00:47:06.346 --> 00:47:11.072
There really wasn't a way to convert your Python 2 code to Python 3.

986
00:47:11.275 --> 00:47:12.838
The tools didn't exist.

987
00:47:13.056 --> 00:47:14.869
I started writing blog posts about it,

988
00:47:14.916 --> 00:47:18.338
why? I think that in a way in which Python 3 works right now,

989
00:47:18.541 --> 00:47:19.556
I just cannot see the move.

990
00:47:31.713 --> 00:47:33.653
He was a valued community member.

991
00:47:33.974 --> 00:47:35.155
And at the time,

992
00:47:35.275 --> 00:47:40.438
I was actually quite surprised that he was so viciously attacking Python

993
00:47:41.079 --> 00:47:45.900
3. I was probably even more negative on it than appropriate.

994
00:47:45.954 --> 00:47:48.822
But Python has such a good run and it puts so much energy into it.

995
00:47:49.742 --> 00:47:53.275
I was part of building out web frameworks and all these libraries.

996
00:47:53.681 --> 00:47:54.117
I felt like,

997
00:47:54.134 --> 00:47:58.603
why are we ruining all of this with this move that didn't even have that many benefits?

998
00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:00.164
I had not...

999
00:48:00.586 --> 00:48:02.503
Appreciated how many people

1000
00:48:03.250 --> 00:48:09.617
already had enormous code bases or were on their way to building up enormous code bases.

1001
00:48:10.097 --> 00:48:14.577
Payback for that was that I had to initiate the project at Dropbox.

1002
00:48:14.938 --> 00:48:21.983
We had a pretty long road to migrate many, millions of lines of Python 2 code.

1003
00:48:22.125 --> 00:48:26.188
Five million lines of code in the server alone and another million for the client.

1004
00:48:26.858 --> 00:48:29.577
That is a very large pile of code to...

1005
00:48:29.661 --> 00:48:30.422
transform.

1006
00:48:30.563 --> 00:48:36.387
And so we had to invent ways of sort of doing it in pieces.

1007
00:48:56.184 --> 00:48:56.309
A

1008
00:48:56.371 --> 00:48:58.184
funny sticker I find in my pocket.

1009
00:48:59.230 --> 00:49:01.072
There's a build tool called Bazel.

1010
00:49:01.393 --> 00:49:03.793
It's sort of a frozen version of Python 2.

1011
00:49:04.753 --> 00:49:06.317
So here the sticker says,

1012
00:49:07.121 --> 00:49:08.481
after re-education,

1013
00:49:08.762 --> 00:49:09.659
enemy of the people,

1014
00:49:09.777 --> 00:49:10.340
Python,

1015
00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:12.722
denounced their bourgeois class,

1016
00:49:12.887 --> 00:49:15.965
renounced formalist notions like turing, completeness,

1017
00:49:16.402 --> 00:49:19.543
and began a new life as citizen Starlark.

1018
00:49:21.184 --> 00:49:24.621
This is especially an example of Benjamin Peterson's humor.

1019
00:49:27.489 --> 00:49:29.012
I had the fortune or the misfortune,

1020
00:49:29.012 --> 00:49:30.353
depending on how you see it,

1021
00:49:30.574 --> 00:49:30.972
to be the

1022
00:49:31.695 --> 00:49:35.039
Python 2.7 release manager for an entire decade.

1023
00:49:36.659 --> 00:49:48.456
We had to adjust our plans for Python 3 and for Python 2 so that there was a longer series of releases where there were both new Python 2 versions and new Python 3 versions.

1024
00:49:48.878 --> 00:49:52.300
What ended up happening is in the community was like maintaining 2 and 3,

1025
00:49:53.081 --> 00:49:54.003
and that created a lot of burden.

1026
00:49:54.628 --> 00:49:57.097
And so this is happening, all during the growth of NumPy.

1027
00:49:57.961 --> 00:49:59.222
We made it work for Python 2,

1028
00:49:59.702 --> 00:50:02.483
and then I think Python 3.1,

1029
00:50:02.483 --> 00:50:02.744
I think,

1030
00:50:02.764 --> 00:50:03.264
or 3.2,

1031
00:50:03.264 --> 00:50:04.244
We also made it work there,

1032
00:50:04.704 --> 00:50:05.681
but saw no adoption.

1033
00:50:11.342 --> 00:50:13.108
We knew it was going to take a long time.

1034
00:50:14.905 --> 00:50:16.420
We knew it was going to be painful,

1035
00:50:17.530 --> 00:50:19.264
but there is light at the end of the tunnel.

1036
00:50:19.545 --> 00:50:21.764
The community contributed, stuff like lib2to3,

1037
00:50:22.483 --> 00:50:24.748
and other migration tools came out.

1038
00:50:24.969 --> 00:50:28.994
Benjamin Peterson wrote Six. That really helped that transition.

1039
00:50:29.175 --> 00:50:32.679
The language itself became a little more backwards compatible.

1040
00:50:33.135 --> 00:50:36.963
I eventually advocated to bring back the U prefix on the strings.

1041
00:50:37.385 --> 00:50:41.306
And that actually made it easier to write unified code bases that target both Python 2 and Python 3.

1042
00:50:41.791 --> 00:50:45.822
There was a point in time where we made a very strong declaration.

1043
00:50:46.494 --> 00:50:49.947
There will never be a Python 2.8, and Python 3 is the future.

1044
00:50:53.525 --> 00:50:55.867
Python 3 just is a better language,

1045
00:50:56.827 --> 00:50:59.652
and it is getting better over time.

1046
00:50:59.813 --> 00:51:00.394
Python 2,

1047
00:51:00.492 --> 00:51:01.331
on the other hand,

1048
00:51:01.496 --> 00:51:02.612
is a fine language,

1049
00:51:03.456 --> 00:51:05.777
and it will remain exactly what it is.

1050
00:51:06.175 --> 00:51:06.996
For a long time,

1051
00:51:07.019 --> 00:51:10.628
there was a lot of measurement of how much Python 2 usage is there,

1052
00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:12.067
how much Python 3 usage is there.

1053
00:51:12.300 --> 00:51:14.112
I think it was when Pycon was in Portland,

1054
00:51:14.347 --> 00:51:16.612
was roughly when we started to see like 50-50.

1055
00:51:17.409 --> 00:51:18.956
Once 3.4 came out,

1056
00:51:19.128 --> 00:51:22.253
it actually added some features that were interesting to people.

1057
00:51:22.498 --> 00:51:22.637
oh,

1058
00:51:22.797 --> 00:51:24.039
I want that capability.

1059
00:51:24.699 --> 00:51:25.061
So to me,

1060
00:51:25.221 --> 00:51:27.842
Python 3.4 was really Python 3.0.

1061
00:51:28.784 --> 00:51:30.827
And then 3.5 was an even bigger milestone.

1062
00:51:31.224 --> 00:51:33.927
That was the one that got widespread adoption of Python 3.

1063
00:51:34.873 --> 00:51:36.913
And by the time Python 3.5 came out,

1064
00:51:36.914 --> 00:51:38.827
then it was clear that Python 3 would work.

1065
00:51:39.170 --> 00:51:43.139
And then you started to have companies come out and give talks, like Instagram's talk,

1066
00:51:43.202 --> 00:51:44.420
which I believe was also important.

1067
00:51:44.422 --> 00:51:45.061
It was a big deal.

1068
00:51:48.780 --> 00:51:48.983
Yes,

1069
00:51:49.061 --> 00:51:49.827
you heard it, right.

1070
00:51:50.186 --> 00:51:51.545
Instagram has been running...

1071
00:51:51.989 --> 00:51:54.010
Fully on Python 3 for a few months.

1072
00:51:55.092 --> 00:51:56.034
The whole process took,

1073
00:51:56.112 --> 00:51:56.514
I would say,

1074
00:51:56.554 --> 00:51:57.956
about 9 to 10 months.

1075
00:51:58.135 --> 00:52:02.983
And I think Instagram is the largest production deployment for Python at the time.

1076
00:52:03.382 --> 00:52:04.639
She gave a very good,

1077
00:52:04.820 --> 00:52:07.905
very thorough talk, explaining why they did it.

1078
00:52:08.061 --> 00:52:08.623
Two main things,

1079
00:52:08.686 --> 00:52:09.967
typing and async IO.

1080
00:52:10.311 --> 00:52:11.092
How they did it.

1081
00:52:11.327 --> 00:52:15.498
We cleaned out all the libraries that are not making the migration from Python 2 to 3.

1082
00:52:15.655 --> 00:52:16.686
How you should do it.

1083
00:52:16.967 --> 00:52:17.514
Unitest.

1084
00:52:17.858 --> 00:52:19.858
What they had learned during the process.

1085
00:52:20.054 --> 00:52:24.157
We had actually some good performance gains as well after our migration.

1086
00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:37.271
It felt as vindication that at least there were large companies that took the time to do it right and to convert all their code to PIFO3 and were able to do it successfully.

1087
00:52:37.896 --> 00:52:39.458
It was definitely well received.

1088
00:52:39.693 --> 00:52:42.911
We got a lot of people saying we really wanted to migrate as well,

1089
00:52:43.474 --> 00:52:48.427
but we weren't getting the kind of support that my team or my company was giving us.

1090
00:52:48.443 --> 00:52:48.755
And now.

1091
00:52:49.057 --> 00:52:51.141
I can bring this back to my management.

1092
00:52:51.201 --> 00:52:54.842
And that really gave people confidence in migrating to Python 3.

1093
00:52:55.923 --> 00:52:57.083
It became like, a,

1094
00:52:57.708 --> 00:52:57.849
look,

1095
00:52:58.123 --> 00:52:59.005
Instagram can do it.

1096
00:52:59.224 --> 00:53:00.130
Why don't you do it?

1097
00:53:00.231 --> 00:53:01.693
Instagram's getting benefits,

1098
00:53:01.833 --> 00:53:02.630
new features,

1099
00:53:02.731 --> 00:53:03.068
faster.

1100
00:53:03.878 --> 00:53:06.358
Why don't you also want that benefit?

1101
00:53:18.202 --> 00:53:20.342
Projects undergo things like this,

1102
00:53:20.577 --> 00:53:20.764
and

1103
00:53:21.561 --> 00:53:22.655
Python learned a lot from it.

1104
00:53:22.842 --> 00:53:26.920
And it did actually eventually end up, with Python 3 being a pretty good spot again,

1105
00:53:27.139 --> 00:53:28.967
that it was safe to use.

1106
00:53:28.969 --> 00:53:30.061
And safe to use. Sounds weird,

1107
00:53:30.077 --> 00:53:30.358
but like...

1108
00:53:30.858 --> 00:53:33.880
Where I felt like I can actually start new projects on Python 3 now,

1109
00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:40.527
because we're back to a stable situation where you're about as productive as I felt like I was with Python 2.

1110
00:53:40.527 --> 00:53:40.590
Hi,

1111
00:53:40.590 --> 00:53:41.409
Anna.

1112
00:53:41.487 --> 00:53:42.690
Nice to meet you.

1113
00:53:42.692 --> 00:53:43.590
I really liked your talk.

1114
00:53:43.768 --> 00:53:45.371
But it was basically time that healed it.

1115
00:53:45.831 --> 00:53:50.534
When Python 2.7 was declared that there wouldn't be any more security fixes,

1116
00:53:50.893 --> 00:53:52.518
it became a security concern.

1117
00:53:52.706 --> 00:53:54.487
That was sort of the final push.

1118
00:53:55.034 --> 00:54:00.143
People who donated their work to do this migration in the wider Python world and community.

1119
00:54:00.557 --> 00:54:02.938
Eventually got the world running on Python 3.

1120
00:54:03.380 --> 00:54:04.041
But, as I said,

1121
00:54:04.081 --> 00:54:05.623
like, it was a decade long process.

1122
00:54:05.724 --> 00:54:09.748
And I don't think anybody anticipated how much work it would need to move to Python 3.

1123
00:54:10.364 --> 00:54:15.436
I think Python's probably too big to ever go through a transition like that today.

1124
00:54:15.592 --> 00:54:19.092
The community was maybe a little too big,

1125
00:54:19.170 --> 00:54:20.356
but not too big.

1126
00:54:20.764 --> 00:54:24.889
I even still get angry messages, sometimes from people who are like,

1127
00:54:25.123 --> 00:54:26.811
my code needs Python 2.7,

1128
00:54:26.856 --> 00:54:27.967
you need to provide it.

1129
00:54:28.106 --> 00:54:29.264
And I tell them, no.

1130
00:54:31.679 --> 00:54:34.623
I never wavered in my commitment to Python 3.

1131
00:54:34.900 --> 00:54:36.724
It was a lesson learned, for sure.

1132
00:54:37.085 --> 00:54:37.885
For a long time,

1133
00:54:37.943 --> 00:54:40.349
I regularly joked there would be a Python 4,

1134
00:54:40.490 --> 00:54:45.771
but the transition would be handled much better than the transition to Python 3.

1135
00:54:45.835 --> 00:54:47.608
I felt I owed that to the community.

1136
00:54:48.342 --> 00:54:52.592
And now the mantra has changed to There will never be even a Python 4.

1137
00:54:53.217 --> 00:54:54.045
To be honest,

1138
00:54:54.389 --> 00:54:58.202
I don't know how many people in Python even know about the whole transition.

1139
00:54:58.693 --> 00:55:01.137
Because that all ended in 2020.

1140
00:55:01.137 --> 00:55:01.956
At least it's behind us.

1141
00:55:18.032 --> 00:55:18.454
Okay,

1142
00:55:18.532 --> 00:55:19.971
so now we get in the closet.

1143
00:55:21.940 --> 00:55:23.423
So there's the Frisbee.

1144
00:55:24.846 --> 00:55:27.657
This is the most unique merch.

1145
00:55:28.065 --> 00:55:30.827
I've ever seen related to Python.

1146
00:55:32.128 --> 00:55:33.769
Now, here's a significant t-shirt.

1147
00:55:34.731 --> 00:55:36.277
It says Python is for girls.

1148
00:55:37.472 --> 00:55:44.081
I received this anonymously in the mail at Google.

1149
00:55:44.722 --> 00:55:45.487
And to this day,

1150
00:55:45.628 --> 00:55:48.737
I don't know exactly what the intention of the sender was.

1151
00:55:48.769 --> 00:55:50.394
They never revealed themselves,

1152
00:55:50.769 --> 00:55:51.534
at least not to me.

1153
00:55:52.567 --> 00:55:54.597
And I don't know if there was an intention even,

1154
00:55:55.269 --> 00:55:57.112
but I sort of realized at that point.

1155
00:55:58.230 --> 00:56:03.195
That there wasn't a whole lot of women in the Python community.

1156
00:56:04.797 --> 00:56:07.699
And the community also discovered that and fixed it for the

1157
00:56:08.059 --> 00:56:09.099
Python conference.

1158
00:56:14.443 --> 00:56:20.349
This idea of being a place where people from a wide range of backgrounds can learn how to program,

1159
00:56:20.474 --> 00:56:21.896
benefit from programming,

1160
00:56:21.989 --> 00:56:22.833
find community.

1161
00:56:23.614 --> 00:56:25.333
There really was some snowballing.

1162
00:56:25.554 --> 00:56:29.056
Adoption of these ideas across languages at the time.

1163
00:56:30.458 --> 00:56:34.501
Jessica McKellar looks at the speakers at Pycon and says,

1164
00:56:34.806 --> 00:56:35.563
there's only 3%

1165
00:56:36.001 --> 00:56:36.563
that are women.

1166
00:56:37.282 --> 00:56:38.282
What can we do about this?

1167
00:56:38.907 --> 00:56:42.572
She was co-organizer of the biggest Python meetup in the world in Boston.

1168
00:56:43.197 --> 00:56:44.431
She knew what she was talking about.

1169
00:56:44.900 --> 00:56:45.916
It's not rocket science.

1170
00:56:46.041 --> 00:56:46.416
It's like,

1171
00:56:46.900 --> 00:56:48.681
ask people if they're interested in speaking.

1172
00:56:48.838 --> 00:56:55.150
And we just providing like a little bit of support drove a huge.

1173
00:56:55.534 --> 00:57:02.001
Shift in the volume and demographics of the talks that were submitted.

1174
00:57:02.521 --> 00:57:03.724
And then, three years later,

1175
00:57:04.061 --> 00:57:05.021
like, 45%

1176
00:57:05.264 --> 00:57:06.606
of the speakers are women.

1177
00:57:07.286 --> 00:57:08.467
I forget what the number was,

1178
00:57:08.505 --> 00:57:10.849
but I think it was almost even with male speakers.

1179
00:57:11.396 --> 00:57:12.036
PyCon.

1180
00:57:13.818 --> 00:57:15.177
I had an old tweet about this,

1181
00:57:15.193 --> 00:57:16.193
so I just pulled this up.

1182
00:57:16.833 --> 00:57:17.068
It says,

1183
00:57:17.130 --> 00:57:18.708
Hello from your Pycon Diversity chair.

1184
00:57:19.099 --> 00:57:21.271
So the percentage of Pycon talks by women,

1185
00:57:21.396 --> 00:57:22.083
2011,

1186
00:57:22.085 --> 00:57:22.521
it was 1%.

1187
00:57:22.521 --> 00:57:23.943
2012,

1188
00:57:23.943 --> 00:57:25.005
it was 7%.

1189
00:57:25.110 --> 00:57:25.951
2013,

1190
00:57:26.110 --> 00:57:27.050
15%.

1191
00:57:27.092 --> 00:57:31.574
2014 and 2015,

1192
00:57:31.576 --> 00:57:32.175
33%.

1193
00:57:32.177 --> 00:57:32.777
And 2016,

1194
00:57:32.797 --> 00:57:33.079
40%.

1195
00:57:33.079 --> 00:57:34.501
Problems have solutions.

1196
00:57:34.679 --> 00:57:37.579
That was a very inspiring story to me also.

1197
00:57:38.023 --> 00:57:41.626
Something that was less inspiring to me was that at the language Summit,

1198
00:57:41.829 --> 00:57:44.235
there wasn't a single woman in the room.

1199
00:57:45.389 --> 00:57:49.992
And I don't believe we have a single female committer to Core Python.

1200
00:57:50.813 --> 00:57:55.157
There wasn't ever ill intent,

1201
00:57:55.438 --> 00:58:02.570
but unfortunately we fell into the trap of not doing enough. Diversity reach out to try to get more people to come in.

1202
00:58:03.148 --> 00:58:03.664
To be honest,

1203
00:58:03.681 --> 00:58:04.586
it was a lot of white men.

1204
00:58:05.101 --> 00:58:06.414
So Guido wanted to change that.

1205
00:58:06.976 --> 00:58:13.461
I want at least two female core Python devs in the next year.

1206
00:58:13.753 --> 00:58:16.817
And I will try to train them myself if that's what it takes.

1207
00:58:18.139 --> 00:58:18.958
So come talk to me.

1208
00:58:21.322 --> 00:58:25.947
I believe one of the first people who took up that call was Marietta.

1209
00:58:35.643 --> 00:58:40.735
Even though I've always been passionate about technology and programming,

1210
00:58:41.143 --> 00:58:42.518
I also felt it.

1211
00:58:42.885 --> 00:58:46.449
Wasn't a welcoming environment for women.

1212
00:58:47.248 --> 00:58:50.795
My schoolmates who took computer science are mostly men.

1213
00:58:51.257 --> 00:58:52.835
Most of the professors were men.

1214
00:58:53.155 --> 00:58:54.039
And at work,

1215
00:58:54.414 --> 00:58:56.242
most of my coworkers were men.

1216
00:58:56.382 --> 00:59:04.382
And I just didn't really have examples or role models of women being successful in tech industry.

1217
00:59:07.117 --> 00:59:09.820
One of my coworkers went to PyCon.

1218
00:59:10.257 --> 00:59:12.039
He saw that at that conference,

1219
00:59:12.242 --> 00:59:14.443
there is this community called BiLadies,

1220
00:59:16.226 --> 00:59:17.324
and I felt like

1221
00:59:18.668 --> 00:59:19.509
I want to meet them.

1222
00:59:33.121 --> 00:59:34.590
So in 2015,

1223
00:59:34.981 --> 00:59:37.387
that's when I decided I want to go to PyCon.

1224
00:59:38.806 --> 00:59:40.047
At this conference,

1225
00:59:40.208 --> 00:59:44.811
I get to see a lot of women speaking and presenting.

1226
00:59:45.713 --> 00:59:48.213
At my previous tech conference,

1227
00:59:48.378 --> 00:59:49.518
all the speakers were men,

1228
00:59:49.635 --> 00:59:51.034
all the keynote speakers were men,

1229
00:59:51.121 --> 00:59:53.018
so this was really different.

1230
00:59:55.815 --> 00:59:59.862
One of the keynote speakers at that same conference was Guido van Drassen.

1231
01:00:00.034 --> 01:00:00.206
Hello,

1232
01:00:00.331 --> 01:00:00.768
everybody.

1233
01:00:01.612 --> 01:00:02.597
Glad to see you all.

1234
01:00:02.925 --> 01:00:07.097
I want to meet and see the creator of Python programming language.

1235
01:00:07.237 --> 01:00:10.282
And I will try to train them myself if that's what it takes.

1236
01:00:10.442 --> 01:00:11.501
I heard this speech.

1237
01:00:11.802 --> 01:00:12.264
However,

1238
01:00:12.362 --> 01:00:13.123
at that time,

1239
01:00:13.423 --> 01:00:15.661
I just didn't think that it's something

1240
01:00:17.005 --> 01:00:17.489
I could do.

1241
01:00:18.364 --> 01:00:21.030
I wasn't even contributing to the Python community.

1242
01:00:21.208 --> 01:00:23.568
I didn't contribute to open source at all.

1243
01:00:24.818 --> 01:00:25.474
I just thought,

1244
01:00:25.989 --> 01:00:29.599
I'm sure they will find women next year.

1245
01:00:35.318 --> 01:00:36.059
The year after,

1246
01:00:36.139 --> 01:00:40.925
I went back to Pycon U.S. and Guido van Rossum gave another keynote.

1247
01:00:41.043 --> 01:00:43.925
We still don't have two female core developers.

1248
01:00:44.206 --> 01:00:45.143
I think at that time,

1249
01:00:45.190 --> 01:00:47.371
that's something really clicked on me.

1250
01:00:47.487 --> 01:00:50.753
Like, I realized that there's something within me that says,

1251
01:00:50.956 --> 01:00:52.050
if nobody's doing it,

1252
01:00:52.768 --> 01:00:53.362
I will do it.

1253
01:00:55.159 --> 01:00:55.784
I wrote to

1254
01:00:56.159 --> 01:00:59.393
Guido van Rossum and I asked him for help.

1255
01:01:00.456 --> 01:01:02.190
Somehow, I felt really scared.

1256
01:01:02.378 --> 01:01:04.112
I just didn't feel like.

1257
01:01:04.818 --> 01:01:08.442
I deserve mentorship from Guido van Rossum.

1258
01:01:08.561 --> 01:01:12.626
So I was really hesitated to send this email to him.

1259
01:01:13.030 --> 01:01:13.724
But in the end,

1260
01:01:14.130 --> 01:01:14.905
I realized that

1261
01:01:15.311 --> 01:01:16.068
I want to try.

1262
01:01:16.170 --> 01:01:16.326
Like,

1263
01:01:16.364 --> 01:01:19.170
I felt like this was a great opportunity for me.

1264
01:01:19.489 --> 01:01:20.436
I pressed the send button.

1265
01:01:27.414 --> 01:01:28.335
I got a reply.

1266
01:01:28.855 --> 01:01:30.137
He was very friendly.

1267
01:01:30.518 --> 01:01:32.900
He started sharing resources about,

1268
01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:33.157
you know,

1269
01:01:33.239 --> 01:01:35.661
how to get started contributing to Python.

1270
01:01:36.021 --> 01:01:38.123
He offered to do like video chats.

1271
01:01:38.403 --> 01:01:41.489
It's been really helpful to have his moral support.

1272
01:01:41.889 --> 01:01:45.911
We had a pretty sort of deep mentorship relationship for a few years.

1273
01:01:46.927 --> 01:01:51.396
Mary learned the process from Guido and continued to contribute more and more,

1274
01:01:51.536 --> 01:01:52.443
very much around tooling.

1275
01:01:52.552 --> 01:01:55.036
Like, she really found her niche.

1276
01:01:55.525 --> 01:01:57.487
In terms of trying to help make our development process easier?

1277
01:01:58.548 --> 01:02:00.311
It was scary at first.

1278
01:02:00.349 --> 01:02:00.490
Like,

1279
01:02:00.530 --> 01:02:05.213
I just didn't feel comfortable sharing my questions in public.

1280
01:02:05.753 --> 01:02:07.378
I didn't want people to know that,

1281
01:02:08.378 --> 01:02:10.923
I don't know how to do certain things.

1282
01:02:11.478 --> 01:02:15.025
I didn't want people to see that I'm actually not that good.

1283
01:02:16.025 --> 01:02:19.306
But this is how it works in open source.

1284
01:02:19.463 --> 01:02:24.806
And the community has always been kind and helped me with my...

1285
01:02:25.422 --> 01:02:29.807
Questions without saying that you're stupid.

1286
01:02:29.865 --> 01:02:30.065
Like,

1287
01:02:30.487 --> 01:02:32.947
I never felt like I was being judged.

1288
01:02:34.452 --> 01:02:38.990
I think it does start with

1289
01:02:40.233 --> 01:02:45.288
Guido. The fact that Guido was very active in bringing more voices.

1290
01:02:45.478 --> 01:02:49.222
Into Python absolutely made Python better and stronger.

1291
01:02:49.403 --> 01:02:53.349
Just the way the whole community works and what we stand for,

1292
01:02:53.989 --> 01:02:56.130
thanks to Guido's leadership,

1293
01:02:56.411 --> 01:02:59.208
is where I want to be.

1294
01:03:00.090 --> 01:03:01.458
And I think that's true for a lot of people.

1295
01:03:10.739 --> 01:03:11.786
About six,

1296
01:03:11.943 --> 01:03:12.739
seven months.

1297
01:03:13.106 --> 01:03:15.286
After I started reaching out to Guido,

1298
01:03:15.726 --> 01:03:19.146
I was recommended to become a Python core developer.

1299
01:03:20.586 --> 01:03:24.349
It really wasn't until four months ago that for the first time ever,

1300
01:03:26.911 --> 01:03:37.465
there's a woman who became a Python core developer and earned that commit privilege.

1301
01:03:38.137 --> 01:03:42.277
First woman ever to join our team and has continued to be there and participate.

1302
01:03:42.637 --> 01:03:46.800
Try to help us, and always a very good advocate, to try to improve our diversity.

1303
01:03:50.809 --> 01:03:51.965
Now that I've seen the camera,

1304
01:03:51.965 --> 01:03:52.231
let's...

1305
01:03:53.847 --> 01:03:56.550
My life really changed after that.

1306
01:03:57.472 --> 01:04:01.534
A lot of opportunities opened up just because I'm a Python Pro developer.

1307
01:04:08.275 --> 01:04:12.639
Marietta went on to give her own set of talks about how important mentorship is.

1308
01:04:13.438 --> 01:04:17.782
When you don't have role models who you can relate to,

1309
01:04:19.744 --> 01:04:23.603
you start believing that you cannot do it.

1310
01:04:25.744 --> 01:04:25.978
Thank you.

1311
01:04:25.978 --> 01:04:26.510
Hi everybody,

1312
01:04:27.275 --> 01:04:28.197
my name is Marietta.

1313
01:04:28.713 --> 01:04:29.416
I'm a PyLady.

1314
01:04:31.572 --> 01:04:33.306
I run pyladies Vancouver.

1315
01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:36.025
I also help with the PyLadiesCon.

1316
01:04:36.501 --> 01:04:37.163
Ten years ago,

1317
01:04:37.262 --> 01:04:41.246
I was also in this room in the Pyladies luncheon at Pycon, U.S. 2015.

1318
01:04:41.945 --> 01:04:44.507
It was a life-changing event for me.

1319
01:04:45.672 --> 01:04:50.735
It was at that event that I felt for the first time in my life as a developer,

1320
01:04:52.117 --> 01:04:58.327
I felt like I belong in tech. Because I see 100 women in the room with me.

1321
01:04:58.985 --> 01:05:03.735
I just want other women to have role models.

1322
01:05:04.797 --> 01:05:06.235
I hope I can help inspire.

1323
01:05:06.235 --> 01:05:08.601
Inspire them and help them,

1324
01:05:09.101 --> 01:05:11.882
these opportunities belong to you, too.

1325
01:05:12.565 --> 01:05:20.889
You're all the reason. I do this because I know there is still a lot to do. And I know together we can help each other and support each other.

1326
01:05:23.217 --> 01:05:23.873
Okay,

1327
01:05:23.875 --> 01:05:24.342
I think that's it.

1328
01:05:25.014 --> 01:05:26.170
Thank you so much everybody.

1329
01:05:29.264 --> 01:05:34.248
I have been so consistently impressed by

1330
01:05:35.210 --> 01:05:50.376
the Python community's ability to have respectful and real reflection and dialogue about how to steward itself and how to move it forward. In a way that I find so

1331
01:05:50.492 --> 01:05:54.469
inspiring and a vision of what is possible in other communities.

1332
01:05:54.501 --> 01:05:55.860
And I mean that really sincerely.

1333
01:06:06.750 --> 01:06:15.621
There were an ever-growing number of sort of scientific disciplines where all the code was written in Python,

1334
01:06:15.818 --> 01:06:18.802
or a lot of it was prototyped in Python. At least.

1335
01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:22.762
And then the next step was machine learning packages,

1336
01:06:23.505 --> 01:06:26.786
which started with Tensorflow and was later followed by

1337
01:06:27.228 --> 01:06:29.286
PyTorch. For a long time,

1338
01:06:29.309 --> 01:06:39.864
Python was seen sort of as a scripting language that you would just do small things that you need to automate, and not production-ready code.

1339
01:06:40.177 --> 01:06:42.114
And so it wasn't given a ton of attention.

1340
01:06:42.396 --> 01:06:48.255
And then now AIML has sort of changed things, where it is now a business driver.

1341
01:06:48.735 --> 01:06:53.641
Appeals to people who are not professional programmers,

1342
01:06:53.820 --> 01:06:57.023
but need software to do a task.

1343
01:06:57.523 --> 01:07:01.507
There are some other languages like R, you can do some interesting stuff in,

1344
01:07:01.664 --> 01:07:05.492
but Python is really it for AIML these days.

1345
01:07:05.929 --> 01:07:13.773
Python has probably, like centuries of engineering time that has gone into code in the ecosystem, specifically on those topics.

1346
01:07:13.775 --> 01:07:15.023
So if you're using Python,

1347
01:07:15.039 --> 01:07:17.882
you're able to instantly tap into those libraries.

1348
01:07:18.179 --> 01:07:19.641
Meta has PyTorch,

1349
01:07:19.782 --> 01:07:23.684
which has an amazing Python API in front-end people can interact with.

1350
01:07:24.067 --> 01:07:25.286
There's also SciPy,

1351
01:07:25.708 --> 01:07:26.226
NumPy,

1352
01:07:26.586 --> 01:07:26.907
Numba,

1353
01:07:27.164 --> 01:07:27.851
Pandas.

1354
01:07:27.969 --> 01:07:31.070
There's a whole suite of really extensive tools.

1355
01:07:31.836 --> 01:07:37.523
Trying to build a language and a language ecosystem that is amenable to all of that is non-trivial.

1356
01:07:37.836 --> 01:07:39.117
That actually took real design,

1357
01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:39.836
real thought,

1358
01:07:39.914 --> 01:07:44.398
and real ecosystem collective innovation over the course of decades.

1359
01:07:44.648 --> 01:07:46.726
The back-end of those tools are usually

1360
01:07:47.211 --> 01:07:47.320
C.

1361
01:07:47.903 --> 01:07:52.248
Or Fortran, or some other native language that's much faster,

1362
01:07:52.710 --> 01:07:58.378
but would be difficult for someone with an AI background to program in.

1363
01:08:00.416 --> 01:08:03.181
And it continues to be used for all that by all the

1364
01:08:03.925 --> 01:08:06.378
AI scientists developing models,

1365
01:08:06.425 --> 01:08:07.659
and people training the models,

1366
01:08:07.721 --> 01:08:08.909
people using the models.

1367
01:08:09.081 --> 01:08:13.690
And that brings yet another increment of growth to the Python community.

1368
01:08:21.503 --> 01:08:22.824
Python's a fantastic language,

1369
01:08:22.885 --> 01:08:24.006
even if you're not a scientist.

1370
01:08:24.105 --> 01:08:29.569
I just don't think it would have risen to the level of dramatic usage without the science. first,

1371
01:08:29.671 --> 01:08:30.335
data science,

1372
01:08:30.373 --> 01:08:31.115
machine learning story.

1373
01:08:31.475 --> 01:08:33.052
We had a massive impact in the world.

1374
01:08:33.694 --> 01:08:33.935
You know,

1375
01:08:33.936 --> 01:08:40.225
I think one testament to the future of Python is, if you prompt any of the LLMs to do code generation today,

1376
01:08:40.615 --> 01:08:41.740
if it's front end,

1377
01:08:41.787 --> 01:08:42.710
it's going to be Javascript

1378
01:08:43.287 --> 01:08:44.694
If it's back end data analysis,

1379
01:08:44.694 --> 01:08:45.475
it's going to be Python.

1380
01:08:47.475 --> 01:08:48.115
That's the future.

1381
01:08:48.725 --> 01:08:49.990
And Python is a part of that future.

1382
01:08:50.416 --> 01:08:50.997
Lucky me that

1383
01:08:51.457 --> 01:08:53.498
I chose that language and not a different one.

1384
01:08:58.720 --> 01:08:58.845
Hey,

1385
01:08:58.862 --> 01:08:59.104
Diego.

1386
01:08:59.845 --> 01:09:00.002
Oh,

1387
01:09:00.025 --> 01:09:00.206
hello,

1388
01:09:00.462 --> 01:09:01.385
Monty.

1389
01:09:01.386 --> 01:09:02.604
I hope you don't mind being filmed.

1390
01:09:03.306 --> 01:09:04.167
Yeah.

1391
01:09:04.189 --> 01:09:04.306
Ah,

1392
01:09:04.470 --> 01:09:04.893
okay.

1393
01:09:04.894 --> 01:09:05.854
He's not following me.

1394
01:09:06.212 --> 01:09:06.806
All right.

1395
01:09:06.807 --> 01:09:07.087
Yeah,

1396
01:09:07.448 --> 01:09:09.931
she's shooting some b-roll for the documentary,

1397
01:09:09.948 --> 01:09:10.292
I think.

1398
01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:10.542
Ah,

1399
01:09:10.650 --> 01:09:10.962
nice.

1400
01:09:11.119 --> 01:09:16.323
I first used Python in 1997, or something like that.

1401
01:09:17.104 --> 01:09:17.543
Wow,

1402
01:09:17.604 --> 01:09:19.783
that's really early days.

1403
01:09:21.123 --> 01:09:22.546
So it's got 30 frames of animation.

1404
01:09:22.846 --> 01:09:23.585
Oh,

1405
01:09:23.586 --> 01:09:23.905
wow.

1406
01:09:24.104 --> 01:09:25.867
I told everyone that he would hate getting the DSA,

1407
01:09:26.506 --> 01:09:27.467
but they did it anyway.

1408
01:09:28.585 --> 01:09:28.748
Sorry,

1409
01:09:28.765 --> 01:09:29.287
the DSA?

1410
01:09:29.467 --> 01:09:30.569
Distinguished Service Award.

1411
01:09:30.804 --> 01:09:34.210
I labeled him in the annual report as like a leader in the Python community once,

1412
01:09:34.211 --> 01:09:35.069
and he made me take it out.

1413
01:09:35.912 --> 01:09:36.725
Yeah,

1414
01:09:36.726 --> 01:09:37.335
you can see that.

1415
01:09:37.725 --> 01:09:38.554
But nevertheless,

1416
01:09:39.335 --> 01:09:41.444
he was on the steering council for five years,

1417
01:09:42.506 --> 01:09:43.367
and he was a leader.

1418
01:09:43.617 --> 01:09:46.304
I got a job from a Python conference back in 2017.

1419
01:09:46.916 --> 01:09:47.737
I grew up in India,

1420
01:09:47.777 --> 01:09:48.457
I moved to Germany,

1421
01:09:48.457 --> 01:09:49.158
it changed my life.

1422
01:09:49.618 --> 01:09:55.646
So I think Python changed a lot of things for me and I just wanted to say, thank you for making this language.

1423
01:09:55.764 --> 01:09:56.568
It's very sweet.

1424
01:09:56.646 --> 01:10:00.389
Do you mind if I take a picture with you?

1425
01:10:00.390 --> 01:10:01.271
Or that you don't like it?

1426
01:10:01.287 --> 01:10:02.068
I'm so sorry,

1427
01:10:02.208 --> 01:10:06.208
I really don't like it, and especially not in busy places.

1428
01:10:06.381 --> 01:10:06.614
Okay,

1429
01:10:06.693 --> 01:10:07.833
no problem.

1430
01:10:07.835 --> 01:10:08.225
I get it.

1431
01:10:08.256 --> 01:10:08.381
Okay,

1432
01:10:08.458 --> 01:10:10.225
find me in a dark alley and I'll do it.

1433
01:10:10.333 --> 01:10:14.943
Okay.

1434
01:10:16.764 --> 01:10:19.668
I always kind of looked at myself as the bass player of Python,

1435
01:10:19.729 --> 01:10:20.470
which is great.

1436
01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:20.811
You know,

1437
01:10:20.813 --> 01:10:21.690
you can do a lot,

1438
01:10:21.713 --> 01:10:22.573
you can have fun,

1439
01:10:23.073 --> 01:10:24.519
and the spotlight's not on you.

1440
01:10:24.596 --> 01:10:25.957
And I love that.

1441
01:10:26.002 --> 01:10:29.127
I can't imagine having that kind of spotlight on you.

1442
01:10:30.100 --> 01:10:31.381
For so many years.

1443
01:10:31.661 --> 01:10:32.724
I heard a story from an

1444
01:10:33.122 --> 01:10:43.012
Apple VP of engineering that Steve Jobs had turned down their hire of Guido because he said he has his own following. And we don't want to have that kind of distraction.

1445
01:10:49.099 --> 01:10:51.863
Python has always been a language that changed.

1446
01:10:52.283 --> 01:10:54.145
We've never been one of those languages. That says,

1447
01:10:54.386 --> 01:10:57.149
if you write code against this version of Python,

1448
01:10:57.288 --> 01:11:00.153
it will run forever with any new version of the language.

1449
01:11:00.395 --> 01:11:03.636
We just simply have never been those people.

1450
01:11:05.457 --> 01:11:09.292
A PEP is an acronym for Python enhancement Proposal.

1451
01:11:09.855 --> 01:11:15.824
That's a document that's written by someone who wants to make a significant change to Python.

1452
01:11:16.230 --> 01:11:16.605
Basically,

1453
01:11:16.667 --> 01:11:19.042
you're trying to convince people that this is a good idea.

1454
01:11:19.371 --> 01:11:21.511
It would be sent for discussion for a mailing list.

1455
01:11:22.148 --> 01:11:22.889
And then, eventually,

1456
01:11:23.229 --> 01:11:23.488
Guido,

1457
01:11:23.750 --> 01:11:24.871
as the BDFL,

1458
01:11:25.051 --> 01:11:26.511
the benevolent dictator for life,

1459
01:11:26.569 --> 01:11:29.215
would decide whether your change was going in or not.

1460
01:11:30.155 --> 01:11:41.226
But people always have worried that the next change is going to be the one that changes the feel of the language.

1461
01:11:41.726 --> 01:11:43.524
It won't fit my brain anymore,

1462
01:11:43.774 --> 01:11:46.132
or it won't be accessible anymore.

1463
01:11:46.649 --> 01:11:48.992
I've actually seen people storm out of rooms saying,

1464
01:11:49.319 --> 01:11:50.617
you're ruining this language.

1465
01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:52.021
Some people take it very,

1466
01:11:52.341 --> 01:11:53.524
very personally and seriously.

1467
01:11:54.063 --> 01:11:56.625
And the Walrus operator was no different.

1468
01:11:57.386 --> 01:11:57.625
Yeah,

1469
01:11:57.809 --> 01:11:58.367
so pep,

1470
01:11:58.469 --> 01:11:58.628
pep,

1471
01:11:58.688 --> 01:11:58.828
pep,

1472
01:11:58.828 --> 01:11:59.886
572.

1473
01:12:00.426 --> 01:12:02.653
I don't know who coined the term the walrus operator,

1474
01:12:02.667 --> 01:12:04.136
but if you kind of turn your head,

1475
01:12:04.192 --> 01:12:04.934
it looks like a little

1476
01:12:05.636 --> 01:12:06.176
Walrus.

1477
01:12:07.371 --> 01:12:10.886
It was a new feature that was proposed,

1478
01:12:11.184 --> 01:12:12.809
but it was also a syntax change.

1479
01:12:13.448 --> 01:12:15.917
The Walrus operator lets you do assignments,

1480
01:12:16.090 --> 01:12:20.605
meaning put values into variables in places that you previously could not.

1481
01:12:21.895 --> 01:12:24.096
That was probably the most contentious language change,

1482
01:12:24.458 --> 01:12:25.000
oddly enough,

1483
01:12:25.859 --> 01:12:27.280
because it's kind of a minor thing,

1484
01:12:27.363 --> 01:12:34.604
but there was so much feeling about whether that should be added or not that it created kind of a bit of a ruckus.

1485
01:12:35.011 --> 01:12:37.573
When I first saw the Walrus operator,

1486
01:12:37.877 --> 01:12:38.690
I didn't like it.

1487
01:12:39.065 --> 01:12:41.675
It kind of felt a little unpythonic to me.

1488
01:12:42.127 --> 01:12:43.409
But then I started to play with it.

1489
01:12:43.832 --> 01:12:47.877
There was a particular use case that I came up with in my own code that I was like,

1490
01:12:47.988 --> 01:12:48.096
oh,

1491
01:12:48.144 --> 01:12:48.738
you know what?

1492
01:12:49.221 --> 01:12:50.550
This is actually pretty cool.

1493
01:12:51.231 --> 01:12:52.533
And so then I was like,

1494
01:12:52.573 --> 01:12:52.733
well,

1495
01:12:53.014 --> 01:12:54.935
it's something that I won't use very often,

1496
01:12:54.956 --> 01:12:55.837
but when I need it,

1497
01:12:56.015 --> 01:12:57.657
it's really great to have.

1498
01:12:57.680 --> 01:12:58.501
And I turned,

1499
01:12:58.502 --> 01:12:58.661
you know,

1500
01:12:58.662 --> 01:13:00.899
180 degrees and became a fan of it.

1501
01:13:01.078 --> 01:13:02.219
But it was very disruptive.

1502
01:13:05.789 --> 01:13:09.251
Language features, and especially syntax, can be a double-edged sword.

1503
01:13:09.376 --> 01:13:11.438
So one person's succinct,

1504
01:13:11.532 --> 01:13:17.001
elegant code can be another person's unreadable puzzle or a fusticated mess.

1505
01:13:17.594 --> 01:13:19.563
They were very strongly voiced.

1506
01:13:20.243 --> 01:13:23.567
Predictions about how bad it would be for Python.

1507
01:13:23.988 --> 01:13:27.472
And then, just because Python was so much more popular at the time,

1508
01:13:27.570 --> 01:13:30.434
there are so many places where people talk about Python.

1509
01:13:30.472 --> 01:13:30.676
I mean,

1510
01:13:30.753 --> 01:13:31.113
Twitter,

1511
01:13:31.192 --> 01:13:31.472
you know,

1512
01:13:31.511 --> 01:13:32.059
at the time.

1513
01:13:33.636 --> 01:13:34.699
This is all happening in public,

1514
01:13:34.778 --> 01:13:34.996
right?

1515
01:13:35.059 --> 01:13:36.246
And everyone can kind of,

1516
01:13:36.528 --> 01:13:37.199
with low effort,

1517
01:13:37.261 --> 01:13:38.465
throw their head into the ring.

1518
01:13:38.824 --> 01:13:42.590
And not everyone is going to restrain themselves when they're doing it.

1519
01:13:45.923 --> 01:13:47.987
I started being more and more convinced that

1520
01:13:48.345 --> 01:13:50.869
PeP 572 was actually the right thing to do.

1521
01:13:52.268 --> 01:13:53.271
I was the BDFL,

1522
01:13:54.792 --> 01:13:56.175
and I accepted the PEP.

1523
01:13:58.979 --> 01:13:59.877
And the next morning,

1524
01:13:59.979 --> 01:14:00.542
I woke up,

1525
01:14:04.237 --> 01:14:04.595
and

1526
01:14:05.658 --> 01:14:11.564
I felt miserable because of all the attacks that had happened before.

1527
01:14:14.363 --> 01:14:15.684
I sat down at my computer,

1528
01:14:17.064 --> 01:14:18.923
wrote a short email,

1529
01:14:20.385 --> 01:14:21.564
and hit send,

1530
01:14:21.966 --> 01:14:24.608
wherein I announced that I resigned as BDFL.

1531
01:14:25.787 --> 01:14:28.725
And that had an incredible impact.

1532
01:14:30.247 --> 01:14:32.452
Nobody had expected I would resign,

1533
01:14:33.247 --> 01:14:36.389
and certainly not that I would rage quit over this issue,

1534
01:14:37.483 --> 01:14:38.935
which essentially it was.

1535
01:14:56.795 --> 01:14:57.774
Transfer of power.

1536
01:14:58.798 --> 01:15:00.720
Now that PEP 572 is done,

1537
01:15:00.818 --> 01:15:06.962
I don't ever want to have to fight so hard for a PeP. And find that so many people despise my decisions.

1538
01:15:07.947 --> 01:15:11.485
I would like to remove myself entirely from the decision process.

1539
01:15:11.845 --> 01:15:15.752
I'm basically giving myself a permanent vacation from being BDFL,

1540
01:15:16.377 --> 01:15:18.173
and you all will be on your own.

1541
01:15:18.752 --> 01:15:20.954
I am not going to appoint a successor.

1542
01:15:21.798 --> 01:15:23.095
So what are you all going to do?

1543
01:15:23.336 --> 01:15:29.802
Create a democracy, anarchy, a dictatorship federation. I'll still be here, but I'm

1544
01:15:29.859 --> 01:15:32.943
trying to let you all figure something out for yourselves.

1545
01:15:33.003 --> 01:15:35.465
I'm tired and I need a very long break.

1546
01:15:36.988 --> 01:15:37.367
That was it.

1547
01:15:40.211 --> 01:15:41.328
I haven't read that.

1548
01:15:41.375 --> 01:15:41.890
That was,

1549
01:15:42.492 --> 01:15:43.875
I thought, that was pretty well written.

1550
01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:48.538
I like to say he mic dropped his way out.

1551
01:15:48.539 --> 01:15:48.725
You know,

1552
01:15:48.726 --> 01:15:49.350
he just was like,

1553
01:15:49.351 --> 01:15:49.742
I'm out.

1554
01:15:49.867 --> 01:15:50.304
I'm done.

1555
01:15:50.319 --> 01:15:51.319
You guys figure it out.

1556
01:15:51.788 --> 01:15:54.898
So it was a complete and total shock to me.

1557
01:15:55.429 --> 01:15:56.225
Yeah.

1558
01:15:56.226 --> 01:15:58.319
I just felt really sad about it.

1559
01:15:58.684 --> 01:16:03.844
I wish he would have retired under better circumstances.

1560
01:16:04.945 --> 01:16:10.007
I felt I needed to take a step back to sort of recover myself.

1561
01:16:10.649 --> 01:16:12.844
I think a lot of people really felt for Guido,

1562
01:16:13.265 --> 01:16:13.664
you know,

1563
01:16:14.086 --> 01:16:15.726
that he could be pushed to that point.

1564
01:16:16.430 --> 01:16:16.711
Like,

1565
01:16:19.164 --> 01:16:27.149
maybe we let him down to allow the vitriol over this.

1566
01:16:28.688 --> 01:16:32.887
Change to Python to push somebody that we cared about to that point?

1567
01:16:35.708 --> 01:16:46.114
We all perceived that it was like a momentous occasion, or like a significant change. That you would put a mark in your timeline, in the history book, in the history of Python,

1568
01:16:46.208 --> 01:16:46.412
right?

1569
01:16:46.458 --> 01:16:51.693
Because it had been run on the ADFL model for its entire existence.

1570
01:16:51.694 --> 01:16:53.270
So there was a little bit of uncertainty,

1571
01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:53.708
like,

1572
01:16:53.989 --> 01:16:56.020
can this work at all without guidance of Guido?

1573
01:16:56.671 --> 01:16:57.613
Kind of a parent saying,

1574
01:16:57.632 --> 01:17:00.033
it's time for you to grow up and figure it out on your own.

1575
01:17:00.335 --> 01:17:02.096
I'm not going to solve this problem for you.

1576
01:17:05.502 --> 01:17:09.386
First order of business was deciding on how to decide.

1577
01:17:09.963 --> 01:17:12.831
And it turns out some people have very strong opinions on voting systems.

1578
01:17:13.252 --> 01:17:15.144
Programmers love arguing about voting methods.

1579
01:17:15.738 --> 01:17:16.752
I remember thinking,

1580
01:17:17.456 --> 01:17:18.846
this isn't going to work.

1581
01:17:19.033 --> 01:17:20.769
A lot of strong voices.

1582
01:17:21.127 --> 01:17:22.690
It's really difficult when you have...

1583
01:17:22.935 --> 01:17:34.024
Hundreds of core developers and thousands of people online, and millions of people in the community, and probably billions of dollars of software that run on Python.

1584
01:17:34.984 --> 01:17:38.430
You can't think about that because it definitely gets overwhelming.

1585
01:17:38.938 --> 01:17:40.516
I will fully admit it was stressful.

1586
01:17:41.078 --> 01:17:42.828
I had to go to an ear,

1587
01:17:42.876 --> 01:17:47.407
nose and throat specialist because I actually was starting to choke on my own throat from the stress.

1588
01:17:47.657 --> 01:17:52.359
It was not fun because if we couldn't decide on how we were going to decide...

1589
01:17:52.807 --> 01:17:53.448
Project was done.

1590
01:17:53.769 --> 01:17:57.891
We really approached it like the nerdy engineers we are.

1591
01:17:58.193 --> 01:17:59.454
In Python classic fashion,

1592
01:17:59.456 --> 01:18:00.474
we wrote a bunch of PAPs.

1593
01:18:00.978 --> 01:18:05.103
We didn't want to rush it because we knew we were going to have to live with this, potentially forever.

1594
01:18:05.743 --> 01:18:18.618
But we also realized the world was watching and did not like the idea of not knowing whether the thing was going to be around in a year or not. Because we couldn't stop bickering among ourselves about how to run ourselves.

1595
01:18:18.908 --> 01:18:20.449
People sponsored different kinds of models.

1596
01:18:20.470 --> 01:18:21.350
I think there was one which was like,

1597
01:18:21.451 --> 01:18:24.292
let's pick another BDFL, because that's what we feel comfortable with.

1598
01:18:24.515 --> 01:18:27.713
And then there was various kinds of committees and councils,

1599
01:18:28.238 --> 01:18:31.119
and we ended up settling on the five-person steering committee.

1600
01:18:31.402 --> 01:18:31.979
Good morning,

1601
01:18:32.019 --> 01:18:32.261
PyCon.

1602
01:18:32.261 --> 01:18:32.823
Cheers.

1603
01:18:33.519 --> 01:18:34.667
Thanks so much for joining us.

1604
01:18:36.182 --> 01:18:38.994
So, welcome to our panel with Python Steering Council.

1605
01:18:39.573 --> 01:18:40.604
Because there's five people,

1606
01:18:40.636 --> 01:18:41.823
you don't have the same problem,

1607
01:18:41.948 --> 01:18:47.369
like all the stress and responsibility of making these decisions falling on one person.

1608
01:18:47.823 --> 01:18:52.809
I actually felt that it made sense for me to be on that first steering council,

1609
01:18:53.070 --> 01:18:56.430
given that there was no longer feeling so burned out or attacked,

1610
01:18:56.890 --> 01:18:59.134
to provide some amount of continuity.

1611
01:18:59.578 --> 01:19:00.539
You know how this goes.

1612
01:19:00.578 --> 01:19:02.078
When your kid goes off to college,

1613
01:19:02.140 --> 01:19:03.907
some of you may have experience with that,

1614
01:19:04.282 --> 01:19:07.234
you're no longer directly involved in their lives,

1615
01:19:07.422 --> 01:19:07.720
maybe,

1616
01:19:07.938 --> 01:19:10.390
but you never stop worrying.

1617
01:19:11.188 --> 01:19:14.547
And that's how I feel about Python at the moment.

1618
01:19:14.595 --> 01:19:15.484
And that's why I...

1619
01:19:20.810 --> 01:19:23.993
Why I nominated myself for the steering committee and here I am.

1620
01:19:25.993 --> 01:19:34.328
There were elections for the second year steering council, and first I nominated myself and then withdrew because there were enough other strong candidates.

1621
01:19:34.969 --> 01:19:40.828
They didn't need me and I was happy to sort of let go of it.

1622
01:19:50.971 --> 01:20:00.278
The legitimacy that came from the replacement springing up from the community is essential to it being accepted.

1623
01:20:00.684 --> 01:20:02.105
It came from us,

1624
01:20:02.582 --> 01:20:04.622
so it's accepted by us.

1625
01:20:05.349 --> 01:20:06.067
It works.

1626
01:20:06.224 --> 01:20:07.716
I think it works for us now.

1627
01:20:08.434 --> 01:20:12.309
There may be a time in the future where it doesn't work, or pieces of it don't work.

1628
01:20:13.012 --> 01:20:14.809
You have to be willing to evolve.

1629
01:20:15.155 --> 01:20:18.282
Change is the one universal constant of the universe.

1630
01:20:18.283 --> 01:20:24.809
And so things always change and you have to be ready and willing to adapt to change.

1631
01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:40.721
It started out as a hobby project,

1632
01:20:40.784 --> 01:20:41.363
definitely.

1633
01:20:41.604 --> 01:20:45.582
I think I probably wanted to prove something to myself more than anything.

1634
01:20:46.104 --> 01:20:49.519
It exceeded my wildest expectations,

1635
01:20:49.565 --> 01:20:51.565
and it actually continues to do so.

1636
01:20:53.721 --> 01:20:59.019
I constantly hear from people whose lives were completely changed by Python.

1637
01:20:59.895 --> 01:21:03.118
And it has created this incredible community,

1638
01:21:03.458 --> 01:21:09.305
which was also a complete sort of bonus over everything else

1639
01:21:09.884 --> 01:21:11.047
I had anticipated.

1640
01:21:11.305 --> 01:21:21.377
This community that has like a massive conference every year and smaller conferences in every continent,

1641
01:21:21.658 --> 01:21:22.064
I think,

1642
01:21:22.095 --> 01:21:23.220
except Antarctica.

1643
01:21:24.814 --> 01:21:27.845
There was one of the Python conferences where there was...

1644
01:21:28.028 --> 01:21:30.751
A few thousand people in the audience.

1645
01:21:31.270 --> 01:21:33.032
I remember just looking around and going,

1646
01:21:33.813 --> 01:21:35.574
this is mind-blowing.

1647
01:21:36.355 --> 01:21:37.676
That's the point at which

1648
01:21:38.536 --> 01:21:41.582
I knew we had achieved something important,

1649
01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:47.465
something that made a difference in people's lives and in the world.

1650
01:21:49.434 --> 01:21:54.653
Python turned out to be much more successful than perhaps any of us thought,

1651
01:21:54.715 --> 01:21:55.028
except...

1652
01:21:55.783 --> 01:21:57.005
Maybe Guido and his team,

1653
01:21:57.126 --> 01:21:59.688
I think they always believed that this was the future.

1654
01:21:59.726 --> 01:22:00.207
And, of course,

1655
01:22:00.247 --> 01:22:02.109
it's now one of the most popular,

1656
01:22:02.328 --> 01:22:05.212
if not the most popular programming language in the world.

1657
01:22:05.453 --> 01:22:10.320
He spent two weeks in Christmas in Like 1989, writing a programming language because he thought it would be fun.

1658
01:22:10.399 --> 01:22:16.890
Like, who would have imagined that that would be such a life-altering and also world-altering thing to have done?

1659
01:22:17.345 --> 01:22:19.984
I think it's been great for the world.

1660
01:22:20.109 --> 01:22:24.188
I think it's made people feel like they can get into programming.

1661
01:22:24.435 --> 01:22:25.655
When they never thought they could.

1662
01:22:25.837 --> 01:22:28.078
I think it made programming accessible to people.

1663
01:22:28.354 --> 01:22:42.284
It's literally part of kindergarten through grade 12 education around the world. And is on Mars. Thanks to being used as a scripting language to process the parachute at the Perseverance Rover landing.

1664
01:22:42.471 --> 01:22:45.738
Like, it's hard to think of anything that hasn't been touched by some Python code somewhere.

1665
01:22:45.988 --> 01:22:47.082
It's mind-boggling.

1666
01:22:47.738 --> 01:22:48.925
It's an important language.

1667
01:22:49.488 --> 01:22:52.409
It's a popular language, that's a vibrant and

1668
01:22:52.804 --> 01:23:07.775
relevant language today, as much as it was in the past, and I believe as much as it will be in the future. Programmers 30 years from now will be like, Oh yeah, you know, I'm still using Python. Just like today, people are still using Fortran and C and

1669
01:23:07.777 --> 01:23:16.306
C plus plus. And those are old languages, you know, too, in the scheme of thing scheme list, another old language. So, yeah,

1670
01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:40.670
now

1671
01:23:40.685 --> 01:23:42.295
I keep thinking of, like, weird jokes.

1672
01:23:42.608 --> 01:23:44.795
There's this library in Python called pickles,

1673
01:23:45.764 --> 01:23:48.014
because pickle is a funny word,

1674
01:23:48.060 --> 01:23:48.372
I guess.

1675
01:23:48.983 --> 01:23:51.435
The documentation used to have a footnote about

1676
01:23:51.652 --> 01:23:53.359
how you should imagine Guido and

1677
01:23:53.801 --> 01:23:55.609
Jim sniffing pickles.
